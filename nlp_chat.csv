1,Must be! Let's lay out,0
2,"Even better, I threw the link to this chat into the channel for everyone to seehttps://t.me/nlp_chat",0
3,We have a chat: https://t.me/nlp_chat,0
4,Hi Nlps. Condolences to the rest,0
5,Why are you condoling?,0
6,Maybe because they didn‚Äôt sign up for such a cool course?),0
7,Can you please link to the lecture?,0
8,"did you get a link to the course page on github? here there will be lectures and all the materials, I have not had time to post the slides, unfortunately",0
9,Is it possible to stick a link to the channel in the description of this chat?,0
10,Can you duplicate this link here or in the channel?,0
11,Channel: https://t.me/+FzhGUmqIe9VkOGFiChat: https://t.me/nlp_chat Site with materials: https://karpovilia.github.io/NLP2022/readme/,0
12,Let's collect everything now,0
13,"I mean in the info group so that in the future I don‚Äôt jump on the fasteners, if possible)",0
14,I will become an advanced cart user this way,0
15,It remains to stick a link to the chat in the info channel and there will be a mutual import,0
16,And when will the distribution of the seminar groups?,0
17,oh thank you,0
18,now and will,0
19,"tell me, please, which group will go slower?",0
20,what does slower mean? ü§®,0
21,Haven't posted yet?,0
22,more details about everything,0
23,Will quizzes and homework be the same at the same time?,0
24,and what day and at what time will the seminars in the online group?,0
25,"like at the same time, as far as I understand",0
26,Can you please tell me if the seminars are recorded and when will the recordings be posted?,0
27,"By the way, it would be nice if the notes of the previous lecture were posted before the next one in order to prepare for quizzes",0
28,"well, and semov too",0
29,We are working on it!,0
30,"Ilya has all the records, so you can ping him",0
31,Will there be quizzes during seminars or lectures?,0
32,"No, in my spare time",0
33,"In my opinion, tickets are given for several days",0
34,"hmm, where do you get his tag from?",0
35,"And what actually affects the distribution by semes? If you come to another teacher, he won‚Äôt kick you out",0
36,It turns out that only for checking copies / dz?,0
37,Then it is strictly more profitable to be in a weak group so that your work looks better in contrast.,0
38,We hope for your responsibility and respect for classmates that you will not do this,0
39,Is an offline lecture planned today or is it only in zoom?,0
40,Can I have an actual zoom link?,0
41,do we have a playlist with records?,0
42,will there be a quiz today?,0
43,Where will the seminar be?,0
44,and you got kicked too,0
45,A little later will,0
46,seminar in the lecture room will be?,0
47,will be in the lecture room.,0
48,"Let's go to the lecture hall, they say a lot to people",0
49,Are you talking about an online or offline workshop?,0
50,"he will be one for all from Ilya, they said",0
51,"No, it will be online on Sat.",0
52,at what time.....,0
53,"So, is there no quiz today?",0
54,"okay, the main thing is that the record was before the quiz",0
55,Will the face-to-face seminar be broadcast on zoom now?),0
56,"yes, it will be online on saturday",0
57,wow is that always the case?,0
58,"no, only this saturday, it will be the same on thursday",0
59,"so, and if I can‚Äôt get to the Saturday seminar, then it‚Äôs not very scary, because the quizzes are several days long, aren‚Äôt they?",0
60,Will there be a recording?,0
61,Will the first quiz be issued after the first seminar?,0
62,It's fun to find out about this after midnight and without posting to the channel or pinning :D,0
63,"In the meantime, I posted the records of the first two weeks in the repository: https://karpovilia.github.io/NLP2022/readme/",0
64,Is there already a second quiz or will it not be given every lecture?,0
65,Where was the first one?,0
66,Selecting a group for seminars,0
67,The second will be tomorrow,0
68,And how long to expect it?,0
69,"Can't say if it's morning or evening, but I'll let you know",0
70,And how long will it last?,0
71,"Until Thursday, if it's difficult, then it can be longer",0
72,"10-15 questions, part theoretical, part based on seminar materials, somewhere to calculate something by hand, somewhere to write 3-5 lines of code",0
73,How do you want a quiz üòä,0
74,Soon everything will be!,0
75,Is the deadline in the afternoon?,0
76,"""Deadline: 11:59 am September 23""",0

78,"you need to 1) find a reference to the colab notebook in the task, 2) find a reference to the Wikipedia_TF_IDF_Dataset in the notebook, 3) use these IDF weights",0
79,"Will there be a lecture tomorrow? (Is it just like they said that they would only be online, or always in person?)",0
80,Online in theory,0
81,"Full-time, Ilya will tell",0
82,Online I'll get back to you in the second module :),0
83,Will there be a broadcast with a recording?,0
84,It seems to be some kind of trick :),0
85,1) you need to specify the quantity,0
86,"2) it is necessary to isolate the original word, for example, ^cat$",0
87,"And if you indicated not the quantity, but the n-grams themselves, can you send the form again? Then there will be a last attempt to be checked?",0
88,Do I understand correctly that the face-to-face seminars of the group that goes faster are not recorded?,0
89,Records of which group are laid out in the repository?,0
90,Recordings from both groups will be posted.,0
91,Good morning! Technical question: use a comma or a period in answers with real numbers? üòÇ,0
92,"Why is there a hash table? In other methods, don't they put words in it?",0
93,And how quickly to receive an index?,0
94,To find a vector,0
95,Word2vec does not allow collisions,0
96,FastText allows,0
97,The difference in this,0
98,"Collisions are about the third paragraph of the slide, but I still don‚Äôt understand why the hash table is highlighted here",0
99,"Just directly critical for the test, and therefore a stupor. The phrase is the most ambiguous",0
100,The phrase is clear: is learning accelerating?,0
101,I'll give you a hint: other answers are more important,0
102,So how does this affect learning?,0
103,For convergence?,0
104,It seems like nothing,0
105,"No convergence, maybe for a while",0
106,"What is strange is most likely the wrong answer, which was difficult to come up with",0
107,"Couldn't get past, sorry",0
108,"Good afternoon, but can you tell me what is meant by the usual arithmetic rounding?",0
109,Doesn't 0.864... > 0.5 round up to 0.87 ?,0
110,when is the deadline now?,0
111,"Yes, but it's a bit counterintuitive...",0
112,"Yes, but the condition says > 0.5 is rounded up...",0
113,"If you read verbatim, Artem is right",0
114,"oh my, it's true",0
115,"about that is, 0.5 is impossible to get",0
116,"Right now, it should be usually arithmetic rounding",0
117,Deadline Saturday noon,0
118,"In other tasks with a similar formulation, is it also arithmetic?",0
119,"Do not worry, if anything, I look through all the answers with my eyes, if something was rounded in the wrong place or a comma instead of a dot - I will take into account",0
120,"Although, of course, the correct answers make my life easier)))",0

226,"Is a self-made model like CNN enough to break through the baseline, or do you need to get some kind of transformer?",0
227,and pretrained can be used?,0
228,"I thought homework should be done without transformers, maybe it was written above that dz for the first 3 lectures, and transformers are not included in them",0
229,"No, it says",0
230,Another question: it seems that they promised to postpone the deadline at the lecture. Is it still valid?),0

233,"well, there were definitely no transformers, there were neurons",0

245,"Check the version of the torch text, there are very unexpected versions of libraries in the colab",0
246,the fact of the matter is that in the latest version of the torchtext they generally deleted it seems data,0
247,it's not in the manual,0
248,I'll try to download the old version,0
249,!pip install torchtext==0.9 at the beginning of the notebook,0
250,But this here from the seminar is considered pre-training?,0
251,"in general, in general, the question is: is it possible to pre-trained embeddings?",0
252,"Will the deadline be moved? At the lecture, the lecturer promised about this likeüëâüèªüëàüèª",0

258,"we don‚Äôt have time at all, we have 2 more dz in DL there, one of which has been studying in the Datasphere for a long time",0
259,"yes, at least a couple of days would be super saving",0
260,It will be very unfair to those who are now trying to do everything. Is not it so?,0
261,"But if they were at the lecture, then they knew that the deadline would be moved",0

270,Understood thanks!,0
271,Is the use of different built-in sets like stopwords in nltk also prohibited?,0
272,"in theory, this is not something that is pre-trained models",0
273,"and you can do the same manually by simply copying this set, but through nltk the code is somehow more beautiful",0
274,"By the way, do I understand correctly that the code of models / processing and everything except the .csv file with test answers is included in the concept of ‚Äúreport‚Äù?",0
275,what is the second task?,0
276,You can use NLTK,0
277,Isn't it just competition?,0

286,The fact that you described it is not penalized,0

289,"Yeah, the question was more about similar methods when we build embeddings for ourselves from scratch on some kind of body",0
