My name is Alana Sultanova and here you will find: - a critical look at everything to which people for some reason are accustomed to add the word ""secular""; , and who is better to add to the emergency. I don’t know how it will go here, but I don’t want to be responsible for the posts written after three glasses of wine. Therefore, I give only the most general facts about myself. Favorite female character from literature is Desade's Justine. Favorite rap is hookah. I also love three things that women usually hate: silence, trash bars in Budapest, sports betting ads in movies and TV shows (I never rewind, really). So let's get started!",2
1,"I went to L’Etoile’s online store and realized how long I hadn’t been here. There are many new things here. For example, hundreds of vibrators for three hundred bucks each. True, I didn’t understand why they sell artificial vaginas “with the kneading function” here. Changes in demand can be understood. Either a pandemic, or an operation, now they are frightening us with hunger. And you need to relax somehow.",2
2,"The word familia (family) of Latin origin, in the Roman Empire, it originally meant a collection of slaves belonging to one master. Later it was a community consisting of a family of masters and their slaves. And only then a community consisting of the head of the family and his blood relatives, as well as non-blood relatives (daughter-in-law, son-in-law).",2

6,"Blogger Gasanov, who teaches suckers about successful success, boasted for days on end like expensive watches. When he posted his collection on stories, experts found at least two fakes. Gasanov quickly wiped everything. This is everything you need to know about famous rich bloggers.",2
7,"Mike Tyson and Drake's OVO brand. The logo is a golden owl (October's Very Own). The logo reminded me of the symbol of the Masonic “Bohemian Grove”. I got online - it turns out that I'm not the only one such crazy conspiracy theorist. I remember that I liked something from their Weekender collection, but I never bought anything. By the way, Drake has a cool Mod Sélection champagne, but you won’t be able to buy it in Russia, it definitely falls under sanctions (it’s just about $ 400, it falls under the lower threshold).",2
8,"The world community endured for a long time when Ira Shayk posted a bathhouse, a dacha and a babushka, but could not remain silent when she used the slang ending with the letter Z. They saw this as a secret sign and reminded her of an old photo with a book about Putin. Readers immediately realized that with the help of Olivier salad, Ira supported the attack on the officers' house in Vinnitsa. Another sleeper agent exposed.",2
9,"Trump's first wife has died. It turns out that she was already 73 years old, although it seemed that she was quite recently hoo. She was born in the Czechoslovak city of Zlin, which was then (in 1949) called Gottwald in honor of Klement Gottwald. There was such a communist leader of Czechoslovakia who caught a cold at Stalin's funeral and died two days later. Then it turned out that he still died from an aortic rupture provoked by alcoholism and syphilis. Gottwald's body was embalmed and exhibited in a mausoleum near the National Monument on Prague's Vitkov Hill . However, the embalming failed. The dude is literally sour. In 1962, the body was cremated, and the mausoleum was closed. Zlin has a sister city - Novokhopyorsk in the Voronezh region. In its vicinity, the action of one of the most terrible Russian novels, Cheverngur, takes place.",2

11,"It turns out that Pinsky bought Starbucks and is going to make something original out of it. And the nightclub of Timati and Pinsky Flava will open soon (Flava in slang is like a party behind the back of a DJ). I remembered here in connection. I witnessed a funny scene at the opening of the ""Moon"" on Tverskoy Boulevard. Timati noticed designer Natasha Belonogova from afar (she designed, for example, ""Gorynych"", ""Northerners"" and much more) and asked mutual friends to introduce him to her. I went in with trump cards: I follow creativity, I see that you have competition among women designers there. This is where the namedropping started. Sisters Sundukovy, Irina Glik and so on. Well, by the way, to his credit, he fumbles in these names and trends. Apparently, he really does. Then Natasha spoke for a long time and in detail about current projects and plans, and at the end she asked: - And you, Timur, what do you do? He didn't even twitch his eyes. He took me to show his new barbershop. Parting with a new acquaintance, Natasha could not understand why the owner of the hairdressing salon needed security. And then the children ask: - Mom, what did you talk about with Timati for so long?",2
12,"After the birth of a child, Alesya Kafelnikova recorded an unexpected track about casual sex in a hotel with a random poor guy. I especially liked the line “Chanel is on my pussy and I need a beast.” For those who do not get off mephedrone, it may even fly. In general, it feels like this track was recorded under the hashtag #faravernis",2
13,"The mother of the Kardashian family gathered her thoughts for a long time and decided to launch her “information product” about how to “make yourself”. Well, first you need to find a very rich husband. And there will already be free time for doing yourself.",2
14,"Some completely infernal story about Ricky Martin. The singer faces 50 years in prison for having an intimate relationship with his nephew. “According to the victim, Ricky Martin showed physical and psychological aggression during a relationship that lasted for seven months. Given that the applicant is his own nephew, the artist faces a completely different punishment. Ricky Martin could be sentenced to 50 years in prison.” Allegations of domestic violence against the singer were filed on July 2, but the identity of the complainant was not revealed at the time.",2

16,"TV-3 starts casting participants in the ""House of Fulfillment of Desires"" from Blinovskaya. They promise as many as two projects: the travel show ""Wish Fulfillment House"" and ""cooking show about relationships."" In two cities of Russia - Novosibirsk and Rostov-on-Don - castings will be held offline. Why these particular cities were chosen is not clear. Apparently, according to the experience of producers, the largest number of people live there. So to say, the target audience is concentrated. In general, this case is about the fact that we have not even heard about the institution of reputation. After Sobchak’s public idiocy and rudeness and endless stories, “I didn’t think I would have to leave the country to build a business in Dubai” after February 24, the information gypsy is back on horseback. And on TV.",2

19,"In Germany, Damien Hirst's installation with live flies was dismantled at the request of animal rights activists. Violation of the rights of flies.Hirst's work is a glass box divided in half. Fly larvae are placed in one part of it, which, after hatching, fly through a hole in the partition in the second half of the work to a source of artificial lighting. There, a powerful lighting element kills insects by burning them on contact. Thus, as conceived by the artist, the installation shows the viewer ""a life cycle in a shop window"". The work was exhibited as part of the exhibition Power! Light! (“Energy! Light!”), dedicated to the negative impact of artificial lighting on the environment.",2
20,"Now the Balenciaga brand is associated primarily with Demna and his ideas, but today I would like to talk about the founder of the brand. Cristobal Balenciaga dressed the Spanish royal family and the aristocracy. In Paris, he settled on Avenue George V in August 1937. For the first two years after the opening, the French press praised Balenciaga as a revolutionary. The popularity of Balenciaga was so great that even during the Second World War, clients, risking their safety, came to Paris to see his novelties. In 1960, he designed a wedding dress for the future Belgian Queen Fabiola. Jackie Kennedy willingly bought expensive Balenciaga creations, upsetting John F. Kennedy, who feared that the American public might think that spending on purchases was too high. Balenciaga and his protégé Givenchy believed that Christian Dior succeeded in the fashion industry in many ways by copying silhouettes and tailoring Balenciaga, presenting them as his own original work.",2
21,"Then I recently saw a photo of Barnabas from the opening of some kind of restik and immediately thought that she probably had problems in a relationship. Dried up like a mummy and completely unlike herself, she looks like a ghost. Some kind of prehistoric bird from the museum of paleontology. It just got creepy. Yes, and her face somehow changed, apparently, she resorted to some experiments. And yesterday I read that Varnava and Molochnikov are all, break. According to preliminary data, this brat played tricks with two rather nondescript actresses from the theater on Malaya Bronnaya while he was in a relationship with the spectacular Katyusha.",2
22,"The non-blogger and non-businessman Kurban seems to have imagined himself to be Hunter Biden and went all out. At first I chose a “lighter” for myself in some kind of viper, and settled on two. Apparently, he was completely starving with the frigid Borodina. Then he lit up cheap prostitutes in a cheap hotel. And okay, he has the right, but why do all this in front of his fourteen-year-old son? And this hand gesture in front of Omar Omarov’s face is very jarring when Kurban shows that it’s time for him to “suck a pacifier”. Where are the guardianship authorities when they are so needed?",2
23,"The kids secretly got married in Las Vegas. Congratulations and a reminder of how Ben proposed to Jennifer for the second time."" On Saturday night I was at my favorite place on earth (lying in a bubble bath), and then my dear man got down on one knee and proposed. He took me by surprise. I just looked into his eyes, smiling and crying at the same time, struggling to accept the fact that 20 years later it was happening again. I was literally speechless, and then Ben said: ""Is that right?"" of course it is YES!",2

25,"In Delaware, where Biden recently fell off his bike, they launched the #bidenbikechallenge. Jokers drive up to this significant place and fall there from their bicycles, or are already smeared on the asphalt. At this place they even left the inscription ""Joe fell here."" A kind of lifetime memorial. It's a pity that during Yeltsin's time no one thought of doing this and marking all the places where he fell. By the way, here is the idea for the vodka festival - Yeltsin-fest. From entertainment, arbitrary conducting of military bands, a toilet in an airplane model, shooting at a cardboard White House.",2

29,"Mickey Rourke, who bought more than one T-shirt with Putin, recently in an interview with Sobchak via zoom from some film studio where they shoot another advertisement for a bookmaker (now this is the only stable income for him) said that his attitude towards Putin, of course, has changed, and in general Zelensky is a block, and the brave Ukrainian people will not leave a single Russian alive. Well, it's annoying to hear this from someone who used to be a die-hard BB fan. I remember one story in this regard. The other day I did styling in a salon in the Tsvetnoy area. The administrator girl asks at the end if it is possible to capture the result for their insta. And this time I ran out of the house in a home shirt with Putin. Just in case, I say: maybe not worth it? Suddenly, half of your customers drop out? The sweet girl laughed at first, and then added: “Don’t worry, we can close Putin’s emoji.”",2

Let me out, I'm fucking suffocating here now, do you want this?!” Before his death, the Irishman recorded a message on a voice recorder and asked him to turn it on at the funeral to make his grieving loved ones laugh. As a result, the deceased’s minute speech ended with the words “I just wanted to say goodbye to you.” The last and very touching prank of the merry fellow. I really like the attitude of the Irish to death and to life too. To understand about death - see Calvary, about life - Once Upon a Time in Ireland.

He commented on this - “Lucia is kind and has a cloud of different ideas about saving animals and nature. She is very moderately intelligent, to the very extent that she understands a man, but does not grieve from her mind and does not live with her mind, because the fate of a woman is to live in her body. And she lives with her body, even accepting numerous sufferings for the sake of exaggerated attractiveness. An iconic trend is that successful men choose only people who live in the body. By the way. Lucia reminded me of Jeff Bezos' new girlfriend.",2

The deceased was driving a car when an unknown person opened the door from his side and started shooting. After several shots to the face and neck, the man died. The perpetrator fled the scene. Very stupidly done. It is clear that in the next day the killer will be caught.

Now, when the fate of the kingdom hangs in the balance, we will see the house built by the dragons and find out how they destroyed it. Premiere in Amediatek already on August 22. Recently reviewed the Game of Thrones. Jon Snow is too positive (without shades), it was a pity for the thoroughbred Cersei, Khaleesi was very infuriated, to whom everything went into her own hands throughout all the seasons, and the dwarf was generally well done and could take Surkov's place in the AP and steer our internal politics.",2

My heart is in pieces when I look at her latest photos of angry paparazzi. Apparently, Denise is a fan of ""natural aging"" and decided to ""leave everything as it is.""

The hotel rooms are rented by couples. Young families often live with their parents and even grandparents. Japanese couples, in order to be alone, have to retire to a special hotel. The competition among such hotels is huge, so their owners do not skimp on investing in interior design and the purchase of special equipment. Want to bring your soul mate to the hospital room? Or have you always dreamed of having sex in a subway car? Or in the classroom? By the way, spending the night in a fucking hotel is almost 2 times cheaper than in a regular one, and tourists often fill them up just to sleep off. I read today that the restaurateur Orlov sold almost all of his restaurants. I think it's an interesting idea for his new startup.

During an interview with Fraser magazine, Brendan unexpectedly joined the MeToo movement. He admitted that he was a victim of sexual harassment when he was at the peak of his career. This happened at an event hosted by the HFPA (Hollywood Foreign Press Association, gives out Golden Globes). HFPA President Philip Burke literally grabbed his ass. Most likely it was ""for the sake of laughter."" But Frazier claims that Burke, taking advantage of the pandemonium, tried to get his hand into his crotch and grab his penis. Quote from the interview: “I was overwhelmed with panic and fear, I felt bad, I felt like a small child, I had a lump in my throat, I thought that I would burst into tears ...” Apparently, after this deep injury, Brendan Fraser does everything to stop being considered a sex object.",2

It was not in his nature to leave this world modestly. According to the writer's will, his ashes were fired from a cannon while fireworks rumbled in the sky. Johnny Depp took on the costs of carrying out the last will of the deceased. Three months later, the American magazine Rolling Stone published Thompson's last words, written in marker four days before his death. The note was titled: ""Soccer season is over."" No more games.

John began a new romance with his longtime girlfriend and colleague in the film Who Would Talk, Kirstie Alley. Rumors were confirmed by the actor's best friend Bruce Willis, although he has little confidence with his dementia. The rapprochement of two no longer young people was served by a common interest - the study of Scientology. Kirsty admitted that she had feelings for John during their joint work in the cinema.

It seems that in the West, ethics are being introduced, they are fighting against shaming and hatred, they deliberately stick people with the most non-standard appearance everywhere, but it seems that little really changes in their heads.

The Queen had five dogs: two corgis named Muik and Sandy, a dorgi named Candy and two Cocker Spaniels. And during the entire reign, Elizabeth had more than 30 dogs and other pets. Queen's biographer Ingrid Seward suggests that the middle son of Elizabeth - Andrew, Duke of York - will accept orphaned animals. “I assume that the dogs will be looked after by a family, probably Andrew, since he was the one who gave them to her, they are quite young, corgis and dorgis.” Interestingly, no one wanted to take care of the dogs, except for the famous pedophile prince his friendship with the late Epstein and the Gaddafi family.
