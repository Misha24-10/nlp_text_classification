On his Twitter page, CryptoQuante's head, Ki Young-ju, wrote about it. According to him, these are the largest translations he has seen since 2017.  According to Ki Young-ju, the average transaction amount went up about five times. Moreover, he said that most of the major transactions took place outside cryptocular exchanges. What exactly is meant by this increase in activity and where the coins are transferred, the head of CryptoQuant did not specify.         1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  the bitcoin network has large translations of cryptovals on his twitter page cryptoquante s head ki young ju wrote about it according to him these are the largest translations he has seen since according to ki young ju the average transaction amount went up about five times moreover he said that most of the major transactions took place outside cryptocular exchanges what exactly is meant by this increase in activity and where the coins are transferred the head of cryptoquant did not specify\n","2658  274486                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And are there some wonders who watched the fifth week of the cadets?         0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              and are there some wonders who watched the fifth week of the cadets\n","3388  275216                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tomorrow's lecture will be at 313, Test at 307         0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            tomorrow s lecture will be at test at\n","3198  275026  Guys, a big comment on the competition: - Reset data with a little deanonymization of the columns - the data itself remained the same, simply sorted the columns and divided them into two groups - The data is designed so that there are two agents who interact with each other, so that each agent either wins (yi = 1) or not (yi = 1).

The Authority has developed methods to search for and identify cryptovaly investors.

The authorities believe that, because of Bitcoin's recent strong appreciation to $200,000, investors could have earned profits that were not recorded in their tax obligations.
