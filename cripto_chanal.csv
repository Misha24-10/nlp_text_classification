Advantages: 🔸 DeFi sector is very difficult for the average user. And NFT games help to understand decentralized finance through simple game mechanics. To open a new NFT token, you need to burn PMON, so the number of PMON will decrease and the price will rise. 🔸 Binance began an active cooperation with Polychain: it sold mystery boxes and credited a unique NFT for everyone who bought boxes. But most importantly, on August 24, the exchange will distribute 1 PMON to everyone who holds 3 NFT dragons in their collection. That is, the exchange will credit tokens to the spot account.

Technically, the price has deviated too sharply from the uptrend line and it is time for a correction.

And as we know, the more emotions, especially negative ones, the more likely it is to lose the deposit due to a rash and hasty decision made in feelings. How to stop being nervous and overly worried when opening orders? 💰 The first thing to do if you feel a strong dependence of your mood on the success of transactions is to reduce volumes. Do not be afraid that you will earn a little less in case of a profitable trade. It is much more important to keep your emotions and make subsequent decisions deliberately.✅ And I guarantee you that after a while, when you gain experience and learn to calmly deal with both profits and losses, you will be able to increase volume and at the same time trade deliberately and no nerves!",1

The yellow lines mark the liquidity zones where traders have placed stops. Usually, such a cascade of levels breaks through very quickly due to the elimination of stops.

In our case, the level of 49,400 - 49,500 will confirm the P&I, as well as return the price above the trend line.‼️ Pay attention to the volumes. Recently they have been declining and we do not see large purchases. Bitcoin is not immune from sudden sales, so take into account the possible dump in all transactions and set stop losses when trading on futures.

Locally, the chances of a breakdown up/down are the same.
