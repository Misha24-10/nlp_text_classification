Also, optimism was added by the adoption of a law in the Senate, which will allow the Democrats to single-handedly raise the national debt limit so that the United States avoids default on December 15 😊▪️ Record inflation and dances with a tambourine around the national debt slowed down the growth of the dollar index, and the meeting of the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States reduced geopolitical risks.

The process is carried out by removing coins or blocking at a special address from which withdrawals are not possible. Cryptocurrency burning is technical and economic in nature. In a number of cryptocurrencies (for example, XRP, XLM), transfer fees are burned to protect against spam in small transactions. But the main one is the economic factor, when, as a result of a decrease in the number of cryptocurrencies, the value of each coin increases. Thus, the leading crypto exchange Binance burns its BNB token every quarter, which is included in the top 20 cryptocurrencies, for an amount equivalent to 20% of the profit. Of the originally created 200 million coins, 194.9 million are already left, but the exchange plans to halve their number.",1

39,"What is Beacon ChainBeacon Chain is the main component of the Ethereum 2.0 workflow. With the help of this blockchain, the Ethereum network should switch to the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. The task of Beacon Chain is to ensure effective coordination of POW and POS networks, it is also responsible for communicating with Shard Chains (subnetting system for scaling) and Virtual Machine. Beacon Chain's responsibilities include: appointing and supervising the work of validators; choosing the creator of the next block; distribution of remuneration for supporting the operation of the network; imposing penalties on dishonest validators and other functions. Thus, in Ethereum 2.0, Shard Chain will ensure the scalability of the blockchain, and Beacon Chain will become the overseer of the network so that everything runs smoothly and without errors. Beacon Chain development should end in 2018, and its testing is scheduled for the first quarter of 2019. Unless, of course, the Ethereum developers change their plans again.#helpfulnotes",1

There are no signs indicating consolidation below this level in the current conditions. In the global structure, we should expect a balance to be built in the range of $23,100 - $18,600.▪️ More locally (1 hour timeframe), the orders of large players are actively pushing the price lower, so we should not expect growth above $21,600 in the near future: there are huge volumes of whales on sale.

71,"#usefulnotesWhat is a recession? A recession is a phase of the economic cycle during which GDP declines for two quarters. The economic cycle, like the market, has its own growth phase, then a peak, after which there is a correction (recession) and then a bottom (crisis) , and then everything repeats. A recession often precedes a financial crisis, its hallmarks are rising inflation and unemployment, and a decline in stock indices. Lending is also slowing down, which is often a consequence of monetary tightening. Today, the US already has inflation and correction in stocks, the labor market is doing well so far, but lending will begin to slow down as the Fed raises rates. It is expected that due to logistical problems, the shortage of semiconductors and a number of minerals, as well as the imposed sanctions, the GDP will slow down and the United States will officially be in recession. But the Fed is still confident (or just telling the press so as not to scare) that everything will work out and the economy will not go into recession 🤫@Coin_Post",1

Split (split) - an increase in the number of shares, by proportional splitting of existing securities but without issuing new ones. For example, having 1 share at $1,000 and a 10:1 split would give you 10 shares at $100. Thus, your account balance has not changed, there is still $1,000 and your share in the company remains the same. The idea of ​​a split is to lower the price of one share and thereby make it more attractive to buy (cheaper = better) 🤑 split, the last most famous case with BitTorrent. At the mainnet launch event, for every 1 old BTT token, 1,000 new ones were issued.

Does this mean that gold does not protect against inflation? Actually, no, because in this matter you need to look not at a month or even at a year, but with an eye to several years.

Clearing the confusion: Web3 – proposed by ETH co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014 Web 3.0 – also a concept of modernizing the internet, but proposed in 2007 by the head of Netscape, Jason Calacanis, and implies the interaction and understanding of data on the network by computers. The idea of ​​Web3 became popular in 2021 in the wake of the hype around DeFi, DEX, DAO and NFT. All this is presented as the beginnings of the emergence of the Internet of the future without corporations. In 2017, all ICOs promised faster BTC, now everyone promises a breakthrough in Web3 🤷‍♂️ Web3 is a good idea, but it is distributed mainly within the crypto community. Corporations will not just give up the Internet market, and most users do not care about decentralization. Especially when Web3 services work worse than centralized counterparts and still require some tokens. Save it so you don't forget 😉@Coin_Post",1

The issuance of such digital obligations is not regulated at the legislative level, and therefore all the benefits of security tokens are provided only by the word of honor of the ICO project. Financial regulators, in particular the US SEC, can equate the sale of any tokens to the issuance of unregistered securities, which is fraught with a fine and company closure. Therefore, if ICOs want to sell their tokens to US investors, they must register with the SEC and fulfill a number of requirements. Or hold a token sale in another country and not attract investors from the USA. #useful notes",1

Regardless of the official reason for the closure of the project, the money literally dissolves into thin air according to a pre-arranged fraudulent scheme. There is no universal means of protection against scam, because the company can create an active appearance of work before and after the launch.

They will simply change the packaging and resell at exorbitant prices. But even such a strange Chinese friendship has its limits, they absolutely do not want to beg the West for new sanctions, and for this reason: - Chinese banks ICBC and Bank of China suspended transactions with Russian exporters and recommended not to buy coal from the Russian Federation.- The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (founded and financed by China) stopped working in the Russian Federation.

2260,"#non-financial councilThe ruble against the dollar today strengthened to 57, after which the Central Bank urgently came to the market with new easing of foreign exchange restrictions 😇Taking into account the sharply increased spending of the Russian Federation and the budgeted dollar exchange rate of 73, the current situation with the strengthening of the ruble is a horror for the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance , because exporters are losing a huge share of their income. The reason for the strengthening of the ruble lies in currency restrictions, now the Central Bank is trying to find a balance between the established bans (which killed the demand for the dollar) and tons of rubles dumped on the exchange for the sale of energy resources. Since the beginning of the week, the Central Bank: ▪️ At 5 once increased the limit on currency transfers abroad to $50k. ▪️ Allowed the sale of currency at the bank’s cash desks, except for the euro and the dollar. ▪️ From June 1, the ban on short sales of shares and the purchase of currency with leverage is lifted. 14% and everything goes to what could be even less.

The advantage of such an order is that it is executed almost instantly if there is sufficient liquidity on the exchange. Minus, the execution price is not fixed and in the absence of an offer at your rate, the order is executed at the next application and you actually buy / sell at a less favorable price. 😳Example: Catch the bottom of BTC at $60k, but the price rises and the order is filled in 3 trades at $60.2k, $60.8k and $61k. Limit order - buy/sell at a fixed price. Plus, the application is executed at the specified rate. Minus, the order may take some time to be executed and there is a risk that it will not be executed at all. Example: you place a limit order to buy BTC on corrections at $58k, and the market leaves with one green candle at $70k.

Many perceive it as “Bitcoin” and do not really understand the difference. Bitcoin Cash is called a scam. There is, of course, some truth in this. But there is a serious community behind it, unlike the foremania in the form of Gold, Diamond, etc. Today, the value of any cryptocurrency is mainly supported by the demand and support/community factor in the crypto world.

2861,"What is MimblewimbleMimblewimble is a solution to increase privacy and improve the scaling of the bitcoin network. The name of the protocol is a reference to a spell in the Harry Potter series that makes the victim unable to speak. The white paper of the protocol was published in the summer of 2016. The Mimblewimble protocol offers a transaction mechanism that does not require the use of users' private keys, and the transfer amount is hidden using cryptographic encryption. This allows you to anonymize the sending of cryptocurrency and significantly reduces the amount of data in the blockchain, which increases the scalability of the network. To implement Mimblewimble in the main Bitcoin network, a number of preliminary changes will be required, in particular, the introduction of a different Schnorr signature technology. Therefore, the developers of Mimblewimble are considering options for its implementation through a sidechain or a separate cryptocurrency. So the test network of the Crin coin based on this technology has already been launched.#usefulnotes",1

Deleting the wallet program from a smartphone or PC does not affect your account balance in any way. All payment information is stored on the blockchain and protected by encrypted keys. A seed phrase is a master key, knowing which you can get account management functions by carrying out the recovery procedure. Anyone who knows the seed has full access to the wallet and can manage the funds at his discretion. Therefore, the seed must not be shared with anyone and it is recommended to store it in such a way that no one can recognize it. For example, rewrite on a piece of paper and divide into several parts. Storing seeds on devices connected to the Internet is not recommended, because the information can be destroyed due to a technical failure or stolen by a computer virus. #useful notes",1

By default, it is 14 days, but the trader can change the settings. The main uses of RSI are: - overbought / oversold, when the indicator is close to its high of 100 points or low of 0 points; - divergence / convergence, when the asset price chart and RSI are moving in the opposite direction, which indicates a possible trend change. It is important to remember that the accuracy of RSI predictions depends on the settings, but even in this case, it does not give 100% guarantees, like any other indicator in technical analysis. #useful notes",1

3780,"What is token swap? Token swap means the transfer of cryptocurrency from one network to another, this process is also called migration or token exchange. This is a good solution for ICO projects that are developing their own blockchain. They can issue ICO tokens to raise funding, and after launching their network, the tokens will be exchanged for the created cryptocurrency. For example, EOS and TRON did this. Also, a decentralized application that has its own token and decides to move to another network may need a swap token. For example, moving from Ethereum to Stellar. To simplify the migration of tokens, these processes are supported by leading crypto exchanges. It is enough to bring coins to the platform, and the exchange technicians will carry out the exchange themselves. But you can perform a token swap yourself by generating a special key and sending the cryptocurrency to the address specified by the developers.
