0,"Hi all! My name is Jamila. And I love cosmetics. I have so many of them that my family is tired of evaluating my makeup and listening to reviews. Now I will share with you. For me, cosmetics is not an attempt to deceive someone and appear more beautiful. And the opportunity to show beauty, but not only (and not so much) external, but internal. Several strokes of shadows, blush, lipstick, mascara can change the mood of a woman, and the investigator and those around her. Say more often ""I'm beautiful!"". As they say: there are no ugly women, there are women who do not know how to use cosmetics (a joke that you can not laugh at). Here I will tell and show you my proven products - both in decoration and in care. Let's open the Beauty Box!",2
1,"I’ll start with the mass market, it’s not customary to write about it in the telegram. Although all the girls in the bathroom have a bottle of Pantin or Headendsholders. I have L'Oreal Elseve Express Conditioner: Complete Restore. Double elixir. I tested it for a month. Let's go through the points. Convenient and economical dispenser: shake the bottle, spray along the entire length and comb. Effect: hair smoothes well, removes fluffiness. What does the manufacturer promise? 1. Hair restoration. No recovery, and the split ends certainly didn't stick back together (who would have thought!). Straw remains straw. 2. Easy combing and shine. Yes, my hair is smooth and perfectly combed after the spray. But there is no shine. 3. Protection against electrification. This is a complete fiasco. Her hair is electrifying like hell. Verdict: worth its 450 rubles: smoothes hair, gives a well-groomed look. But the effect is cosmetic. NO PROMISED RECOVERY. Deep hair restoration a priori cannot be cheap.",2
2,"Smash Box The Cali Contour. 6 in 1. A palette that can do almost all makeup! The product has everything for facial contouring: sculptor, white highlighter, bronze highlighter, blush, matte bronzer, light yellow powder. Pigmentation is great, blends great! I also use the palette as an eye shadow. Of course, with its help you can’t make complex evening makeup and smokey, but it’s very suitable for light daytime looks. And it is very travel-friendly: one palette and almost all makeup is ready! Verdict: The Smash Box The Cali Contour multipurpose palette is worth its 3500. Especially if you travel a lot.",2
3,"Another favorite in care. Aloe Facial Cleansing Foam from Holika Holika. You must have heard of him, the bestseller Holika Holika. The product has a thick gel consistency. Foams with water perfectly, gives a large amount of fluffy gentle foam. The aroma is pleasant. Honestly, I don’t know how aloe smells, I associate it with fresh watermelon. My skin is oily, there are black dots and enlarged pores. Therefore, it is important for me that the cleanser thoroughly cleanses the skin of dirt and fat, but does not overdry it. I use this foam for almost half a year, I wash it twice a day: in the morning and in the evening and after removing makeup. During this time, the skin condition has improved markedly. The black dots didn't go away. But the feeling of a ""dirty"" face is gone. And the form in the form of aloe has. Verdict: Foam for light washing - ideal. BLACK DOTS WILL NOT REMOVE, FOR THIS YOU NEED A DEEP CLEANSING. Another disadvantage: the plastic is hard, it is difficult to squeeze the gel. It costs 540 rubles, sold everywhere",2
4,"A product that needs no introduction. Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum is a bestseller. After every cleansing, I apply toner, then this serum. I let it soak in, and then the cream. Serum transparent - cloudy, liquid; density is somewhere between oil and water. Light oiliness is felt only upon application. It smells like weed, but the smell is pleasant. It spreads easily and is instantly absorbed leaving a natural finish. Results Wrinkles serum, of course, will not completely remove you, but slightly smoothes, nourishes. My skin after the serum became more rested, luminous, fresh. This is visible to the naked eye. All in all, the product works. Verdict: Great base serum. For starters, I advise you to take a mini-bottle of 30 ml. If OK, go to a large 50 ml. The only negative, when used twice a day (morning and evening) is a big expense. 30 ml is enough for a maximum of 1.5 months.",2
5,"My channel is still small, but requests for reviews are already coming in. And this is very pleasing. Yesterday, several subscribers were asked to write about the Foreo brush that they noticed on the shelf. I will not beat around the bush, Foreo Luna Mini 2 is my favorite grooming assistant. Due to the vibration, the silicone bristles push the dirt out and clean the pores. The sensation is that a broom passed over my face and swept away all the dust and keratinized particles. I use it like this: I apply the washing gel on the brush, turn it on at medium speed (there are several speeds, you can increase or decrease) and massage for one minute on each area of ​​the face: forehead, cheeks, chin. And I also apply care with it: I apply face cream, turn the moon on the other side and turn it on to maximum power and apply it to each area of ​​​​the face in turn. Care will be absorbed much faster. Verdict: It is expensive - 9,500 rubles, there are cheaper analogues. But if possible, take it. Beauty gadget is awesome. Comes with USB charger with adapter.",2
6,"Recently, my sister gave me a highlighter from Karl Lagerfeld + ModelCo. I'm not a fan of highlighters, but this one is really good. I explain why. Firstly, a highlighter in the form of a fountain pen. Provides precise application and highlighting effect with the ability to control its intensity. This brush will definitely not polish the entire face to a shine. Secondly, the liquid texture is perfectly stewed. At the finish, the effect of light radiance. I apply product over the cheeks and spread upwards towards the temples to highlight and define the cheekbones, can be applied to the lip line to get a clear look of the lips. You can also apply a highlighter pen to the inner corners of your eyes to make your eyes look more animated.",2
7,"What a smart Tina! Made a collab with the Moscow metro on March 8th. Distributes his patches at 27 stations. One question: how did she agree with the mayor's office on the placement of racks in the subway, bypassing the tenders? All entrepreneurs in Moscow know that renting premises in the metro is either impossible or extremely difficult. But Tina did. A strong woman, what can I say.",2
8,"I quite often use a blow dryer and various curling irons to straighten my curly hair. Therefore, we are constantly on the lookout for some interesting hair protection products. I recently tried TRESemme Thermal Protection Spray. According to the procedure: before blow-drying, spray all over the hair and comb through. When laying with an iron, I spray each strand immediately before straightening. Effect. From the first time I can say that the hair looks more well-groomed and easier to straighten. It does not weigh down and does not greasy, so I spray abundantly. There is no ""dirty hair"" effect. And the pump is comfortable with a lock. Before you straighten your hair with a hot iron, be sure to use a hair care product. For example, with this TRESemme spray, it turned out to be quite good. Yes, and it costs up to 1000 rubles.",2
9,"Clay mask in care is a must-have. Almost all of them are plus or minus similar. And this review will not open America. But if suddenly, you are in search, the analysis of SCINIC All Day Fine Pore Clay Mask will be useful to you. In the composition, in fact, the clay itself (mined in the Amazon). Plus various herbal extracts. The texture is reminiscent of yeast dough: porous, soft and springy under the fingers. It is not creamy, if anyone likes a softer texture. It is problematic to apply clay with a brush, I just smear it with my hand. What didn't you like? Large pieces roll on the skin, dry up with “concrete”. Feeling extremely uncomfortable. The manufacturer promised that the mask should reduce the secreted sebum and narrow the pores. But it's all bullshit. The effect is that the first hour - the face will be a little refreshed. Pores in place, oily skin in place.",2
10,"I have frizzy hair, the roots get greasy quickly, lose volume. And on the tip of many bloggers, I tried Batiste Original Dry Shampoo. We take and spray the shampoo from the level of the outstretched arm. It lies on the hair with a white coating, and the closer you spray it, the more the coating. I only apply the product to the roots. As you already understood, Baptiste is very dusty and leaves traces. In order for everything to be absorbed, you need to thoroughly massage everything into the hair, lifting it at the roots. Honestly - it's faster to wash your hair than to ""drive"" dry shampoo into your hair. Result Terrible. Hair becomes dry like wood. No lightness or looseness. And there is no shine. MOST IMPORTANT: After such a Dry shampoo, you want to wash your hair faster. The head itches and is terribly uncomfortable. Verdict: wash your hair more often.",2
11,"Before the panic has seized everything, a great opportunity to walk around the city, eat your favorite burgers and make a couple of cards. So, nice to meet you. Finally, you can imagine what I look like. And from my abundant make-up, you know that I test all the cosmetics I write about on myself. Your Jamila.",2
12,"As it turned out, many do not know the basic safety rules when buying cosmetics during a virus epidemic. I have put together a little instruction for you. Beauty rules while the coronavirus is raging: 1. Do not touch testers in stores. Generally none. Before you, lipsticks, shadows, powders could have been inflicted by carriers of viruses 2. Do not use beauty counters in stores, even if they are ready to make up and style you for free (see rule 1) 3. Buy cosmetics with sealed packaging 4. Order cosmetics online only with contactless delivery. Specify in the comments to the order or warn the courier to leave the package at the door and move away (this is normal). 5. Postpone manicures and pedicures. Often, salons are very small and you sit close to the master. If someone in the salon is infected, you will be infected too. It's okay if the nails have grown. You can remember your childhood and experiment with varnishes at home 6. Do not change cosmetics with your friends yet. No one is definitely immune from the virus. And remember: beauty does not require sacrifice.",2
13,"With closed borders everywhere, I barely made it home from sunny Istanbul. A sharp change in climate does not go unnoticed. My hands are terribly flaky and cracks appear. On the advice of my dermatologist, I have been using one cream for a long time - La Roche-Posay LIPIKAR BAUME AP +. This cream does not look like typical hand creams with a light consistency (such as ""Velvet Hands""). La Roche is very thick and dense. The composition is powerful and aimed at intensive nutrition, and not temporary hydration. Despite its density, it is absorbed in about two minutes. Very deeply nourishes. By myself I can say that the product restores at the cell level. As if the skin was pumped with the missing particles, and it was completely renewed. La Roche-Posay is multifunctional / suitable for hands, face and lip seam. And it is also suitable for babies with delicate irritated skin (tested on my daughter). P.S. The photo shows before and after using the cream.",2
14,"First 5000 subscribers! How quickly it happened ❤️ Thank you, unexpectedly for 3 weeks. Move on.",2
15,"Vivienne Sabo Cabaret is truly the most popular mascara today. And I decided to try the classic version. I'll start with the brush. The brush is small, silicone. There are no huge bristles here. It looks like a stick (and by the way, it is more convenient to paint with such a brush). It is convenient for her to paint both the upper and lower eyelashes. The limiter works great, there is never a huge amount of mascara on the brush and you can always make up as neatly as possible. The mascara perfectly lifts the eyelashes and gives them a bend. Leaves no lumps. The separation of the lashes is excellent. It does not imprint on the eyelid. There is also a minus. Minor, but still: the mascara dries for a very long time. God forbid you sneeze immediately after application! You will have smokey ice ready. And you don’t need to apply several layers either, there will be the effect of cheap false eyelashes. The durability, as I noticed, is average. In principle, she will withstand a little crying and even rubbing with her hand. Verdict: a bestseller has become a bestseller for a reason. You can take. Price - a penny: 215 rubles.",2
16,"Today the tale of a hair mask is Dax Botanical Oils Supergro Hair & Scalp Conditioner. I'll start with the composition: sweet almond oil, avocado, sunflower oil, sesame oil, wheat germ, cotton seeds. Also two extracts: jojoba seed, safrole dye extract. The first time I applied a mask after shampoo, but I did not like the effect. My hair became very greasy and had to be washed. The second time I already applied the mask before washing my hair, with the addition of coconut milk separately (you can use any oils, even olive oil). I applied the composition to the length of the hair, stepping back from the roots, hid it under polyethylene and a towel. I left it on for about an hour and then washed it off. Effect: Hair became soft, smooth. And most importantly: after several uses, I noticed that my hair falls out less. MINUS. The mask with normal use terribly greasy hair. You have to use it sometimes. The mask is good only for very dry and damaged hair. I have curly, oily, thin hair and the mask did not suit me",2
17,"There are a lot of scrubs. But the workers can be counted on the fingers. This is one of the really effective, while not particularly well-known Byphasse Soothing Face Scrub (Series of SPA-care at home). Really removes dirt, and even blackheads. Not all. But for a scrub at home - the result is excellent. Clean, fresh, radiant face. Created on the basis of thermal water with an admixture of rosehip and frankincense extract. The application is the simplest: apply to clean, damp skin and massage for 2-3 minutes. Clean, I mean after the initial cleansing. And rinse off with warm water. I repeat the procedure 1-2 times a week. Verdict: take it without hesitation. The price is reasonable - about 800-900 rubles.",2
18,"My prettiest lipstick ever. Here it is - Rouge Pur Couture The Slim from YSL. Rhombus shaped stick. Due to the unusual shape, applying lipstick on the lips is very convenient. The texture of the lipstick is soft and creamy. Not at all oily, but not dry either. We don't like it when lips roll into concrete. YSL turned out to be the golden mean for matte lipsticks. Another moment: with it visually, the lips look much plumper than they really are. After removal, it does not dry out the lips and does not tighten. Does not stain teeth. Pigmentation is high, and one layer will be enough. During the day, I usually don't even touch up. Verdict: must take. It costs from 2000 rubles.",2
19,"I really love trying new foundations and I buy them much more often than I use them. And today I’ll tell you about the tone from Guerlain L’essentiel natural glow. The manufacturer claims that the foundation is 97% natural ingredients, provides durability for 16 hours. Well, of course not! It's all nonsense. The durability is average, my skin is already oily by the middle of the day. Yes, it is light and weightless, it is not felt on the skin, it does not lie with a mask and film, it is not noticeable on the skin at all. It gives tone, but does not hide imperfections. Although the manufacturer says that it is suitable for all skin types, but no, it is more suitable for normal skin without visible imperfections. And before applying the tone on the face, you need to properly prepare the skin, moisturize it, otherwise it will emphasize all the peeling to you. The finish is matte-satin, while it seems to illuminate the skin from the inside, you can not use powder, as it gives a natural effect. Verdict: more invested in the design than in the composition. The jar gives aesthetic pleasure from use. For 3700 you can find the best option.",2
20,"Next in line is a face wash from the luxury brand Sheseido. Universal mousse 2 in 1 Sheseido Complete Cleansing Microfoam. Let's see what manufacturers promise us: -Deep cleansing of the skin. Yes - after the foam the skin becomes clean to the creak, but at the same time, pleasant to the touch. - Removal of permanent make-up. No, it does not wash off makeup cleanly, I had to wash it several times. For me, Holika Holika foam (I told you about it) does this much better. Ingredients: -Water from Japanese mineral springs Kirishima (contains magnesium and calcium) -Hydro-Wrap Vitalizing DE 7 complex (protects, moisturizes the skin, makes it smooth and gives radiance) Suitable for all skin types. The technique is simple: press dispenser 2 -3 times to squeeze the foam into the palm of your hand. I distribute it over the skin of the face with light movements. I rinse thoroughly. Verdict: Great for deep cleansing. It's not cheap, but the bottle is large and will last a long time.",2
21,"I use makeup bases quite often, today I will tell you about one of them - Benefit The pore fessional Pore primerOil-free balm, with a melting texture a bit like mousse. It glides on contact with the skin and spreads very easily. You need very little money, that's just the minimum, to achieve that same wow effect. The matting effect is enough for a long time. The product has a mild cosmetic aroma. Pore ​​Primer visibly tightens pores and hides fine lines, leaving skin smooth and soft. Suitable for all skin tones. I use it like this: I apply a thin layer of primer to clean, slightly moisturized skin. I distribute with patting movements from the center to the outer edges of the face and proceed to makeup. There is of course a minus - it emphasizes peeling. Verdict: In general, ""pore fessional"" deserves 5 points, it copes with its main function perfectly. The cost of 7.5 ml is $13",2
22,"TRESemme Repair and Protect Biotin Shampoo. By and large, this shampoo should cleanse, there should be no more requests for it. But the manufacturer's promises are fabulous: ""restores 2 years of damage in 1 application."" Promising. But no. It performs its main function in the form of cleansing perfectly. That's all. A big plus: after washing with this shampoo, the hair does not get tangled in a lump. During my test drive with TRESemme, the hair did not visually look any better. Verdict: an absolutely ordinary shampoo for the mass market. And he works out his 240 rubles with a bang, at least due to good cleansing. If you have oily scalp and hair, give it a try.",2
23,"This is a French beauty treat: Embryoliss Lait-Crème Fluide Moisturizing Milk Cream. A universal remedy if you like to smear with one jar from nose to toe. In the laziest periods, he replaces 5-6 creams for me for various purposes. For example: 1. Moisturizing face cream2. Body cream3. Hand cream4. And even a makeup remover! (True, very resistant make-up will not take)5. After sun lotion6. Lip balm7. Base for make-up 8. Cream for feet and heels9. After shave balm for men10. We make a light BB cream for every day, just adding a couple of drops of tonal 11 to the milk. Baby careVerdict: a worthwhile thing, take it. The price tag is about $36.",2
24,"As promised, today there will be something new. About 100% home care. A series of posts about cosmetics that I have been making at home from improvised products for a long time. It turns out no worse than store-bought cosmetics, and the process in captivity is wildly entertaining. Series 1. Turkish Coffee Scrub This is the simplest recipe of all possible. I drink a cup of my favorite Turkish coffee, and the remaining thick will not go to the scrub. Add 1 teaspoon of olive or coconut oil to the thick, and you're done. Apply to the face and scrub with massage movements. In parallel, you can do fortune-telling on divorces, but not necessarily. Leave it on your face for 3 minutes and wash it off. Then apply the usual care: serum, cream. Important: before you start dusting, steam your skin or take a shower, the effect will be much better. Repeat no more than 2 times a month Why coffee and olive oil? Coffee cleanses the skin of dead cells, stimulates blood circulation, removes pollution, and in general, makes the skin fresher. And the oil tightens pores, makes the skin smooth and velvety. Suitable for all skin types. Coffee should be fine to medium grind. Large particles injure the skin. And yes, you can not try instant coffee, there is no sense.",2
25,"Let's go for decoration. Liquid shadows NYX Lid Lingerie. I have shade 10 FAME & FORTUNE - it's a classic silver. And perfect for evening make-up. Liquid shadows on a gray base, mixed with small sparkles. When blending, a translucent coating is obtained between the shimmer and gloss. Very easy to apply, blends well and dries quickly. And now my personal life hack: you can use it as a highlighter and as a topper to create volume on the lips. Compared to ordinary dry shadows, they are very persistent. Do not roll, do not crumble. Make-up removal is also simple - wash off with facial cleanser or wipe with an ordinary micellar. There are a couple of disadvantages: slightly loose and sometimes fall into lumps. But you need to get used to them and everything will be ok. Verdict: good liquid shadows are not for space money - about 500 rubles.",2
26,"And today I will show ordinary Vaseline in a beautiful jar and for 2 thousand rubles. This is the best-selling LANEIGE night lip mask. Gel-cream consistency. It is easy to apply, completely envelops the lips with a greasy, but quite comfortable layer. There is no special stickiness. Yes, it moisturizes and softens lips well overnight. But the result is about the same as from ordinary vaseline from a pharmacy. I didn't see any cumulative effect. Moistened lips will remain for several hours after application, and then everything is new: hello Sahara. Verdict: by and large, for 2 thousand, the mask will do nothing magical for you.",2
27,"Hi all. Today's post-comparison: concealers from MAYBELLINE and MAC.1) Maybelline Instant Anti-Age The Eraser Eye. Pros: It fits very well on the skin, it is easy to blend, both with a sponge and with brushes. The concealer is self-locking. No need for troubles with powder, applied, distributed, forgot! It lays down well, does not clog into wrinkles, and does not dry the skin. Cons: absolutely unnecessary sponge on the head, it is inconvenient to use. Price: 500 rubles 2) MAC Pro longwear concealer cache-cernes. Pros: like all poppies, a very dense and resistant product, it will withstand even sports. Cons: Clogged in wrinkles. Dries the skin - after a few days, peeling appeared on my face. And it must be fixed with powder, otherwise it will flow (unlike Maybelline). The dispenser pours out a lot of product, you can get smudged. Separately, I note that MAC looks great in photos, like photoshop. Price: 1,900 rubles. Verdict: I left Maybelline for myself for every day, sometimes you don’t need to overpay for a brand.",2
28,"While we are all sitting at home here, it is impossible to visit a beautician - no one has canceled the care. In such conditions, it is important that it is competent and correct. It's cool that brands are increasingly doing this kind of thing: Lancôme launched on the website the opportunity to get a personal online consultation from the brand's leading beauty expert on care. A chat on the site is not just a bot, but a real expert with a relevant education who will help you choose individual care. And with the BEAUTYZZATHOME promo code, the brand gives a Genifique eye mask to all orders from 3000₽. By the way, it looks like a mask of Batman, well, or his girlfriend :) Verdict: let's go to select the perfect individual care.",2
29,"One of the most affordable serums in case you don't have 10k per jar. Elizavecca With Piggy Hell Pore Control Hyaluronic Acid 97% Serum for 680 rubles. Contains 97% pure hyaluronic acid! It could be called a concentrate if there were no other ingredients in the composition. Hyaluron is responsible for deep cleansing, so it is ideal for dry and dehydrated skin. In addition to hyaluronic acid, the serum contains: - Vitamin B3 - improves the protective function of the skin - Adenosine - anti-aging component - Allantoin - tightens pores, normalizes the production of sebum - Arginine is an amino acid, heals wounds, damage. Application is simple, like with all serums: after cleansing, apply 2-3 drops, and distribute. After 20 minutes you can already cream. Verdict: Serum moisturizes well. Doesn't slip under makeup. But that's all. Wrinkles will not smooth out, the tone will not even out. You can take the bottle as a temporary one until you save up for more effective serums. 680 rubles fulfills its exact.",2
30,"Now with an abundance of products, drawing beautiful “Instagram” eyebrows is very simple. For this effect, my favorite eyebrow pomade is Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade. The texture is creamy, it is easy to pick up on the brush, it is also easy to apply on the eyebrows. Good pigment, so don't repaint. Applied evenly, without bald spots and lumps. Until it dries on the skin, it is very easy to blend. Freezes in a couple of minutes. Longevity is high - my eyebrows will be with me all day in any weather. It takes me 3-5 minutes to draw my eyebrows. Minus: the fondant hardens and sets very quickly. Therefore, if you leave spots, it will be very difficult to shade them (or remove them). Verdict: If you like expressive, graphic, reinforced concrete eyebrows - take it. I went. Price: from 1800 rubles.",2
31,"Hi all! For a long time there were no posts, I tested this bottle. Today we’ll talk about SOFTNER. Using Sheseido (Treatment Softener Internal Power Resist) as an example. What is a softner? If a tonic normalizes the pH balance of the skin after washing, then a softner is a vitamin cocktail for the face with exfoliating components. The product nourishes and gently removes the stratum corneum of the skin. It's alcohol-free. Therefore, after the softner, you can do without cream, if the skin is not very dry. I now have Sheseido. It moisturizes well, and after it I can go all day without cream. And a little smoothes small mimic wrinkles. The composition is saturated, I would even say Japanese: with all minerals, hyaluronic acid, collagens and citrus fruits, etc. I use it like this: I soak a cotton pad and distribute it on my face. Life hack: softner can be used as a mask. I moisten a few cotton pads and leave for 5 minutes.Verdict: A softner is needed in every bathroom. Shiseido price tag 3-4 thousand rubles",2
32,"I often set my makeup with powder, so on the test I have several of these products at once. Now this HALO powder from SMASHBOX. To begin with, the mechanism is very interesting. Inside there is a pressed product, by turning the case it is cut, as it were, which allows you to get exactly as much powder as you need. The idea is great. And then usually loose powders sin in that they are very easy to overdo it. The powder adapts to the native skin tone and practically does not stand out, while it removes oily sheen and fixes makeup so that it lasts a long time. There is no talc in the composition, which means that there are no pores and acne clogged to failure. But it is not suitable for girls with problem skin. This powder will definitely not hide imperfections. It is more needed to mattify and fix makeup. Verdict: To fix the make-up - yes. Hide flaws - no. Price: about 3500 rubles ($47)",2
33,"Hello everyone. Today I have a find for oily skin - MAC Fix + Matte Prep + Prime Fix. What is it for? To mattify oily skin. Suitable as a primer before makeup, and as a fixative after. The effect lasts for at least 6 hours for me. And his face does not look like a fat layer cake. I use the spray as follows: before use, shake well and spray at arm's length. As already mentioned, you can before and after applying makeup. The only downside is the bullet. It sprays too plentifully, small droplets form on the skin, which, when dried, turn into a plaque. You need to be very careful. Verdict: For oily and combination skin, a cool product. Cost: 2100 r. ($27)",2
34,"News from the category of ""goof off"". Cosmetic company Marble Lab, created by blogger Nastya Mironova, no longer belongs to her. After the breakup, the brand went to her ex-boyfriend Patrick Zilli. As far as I know, the business was originally owned by Patrick and was based on his money. And Nastya was only the face of Marble Lab. I wonder if the brand will survive, given that it is tied to Nastya's audience. Anyone who wants a body like Mironova's buys her cosmetics, her clothes and her fitness courses. I tried Marble Lab cosmetics, I can't say that these are unique products. Almost everything can be found analogues in the mass market at a price 5 times lower. But it was not cosmetics that were sold, but the “body” of Mironova. It will be interesting to see how Patrick gets out and whether the brand finds a new body. By the way, courses and sportswear Iron by mironova were left for Nastya, but it is also very unsteady there. It is dangerous to part with the former, having a multi-million dollar common business.",2
35,"The last thing about the section of the cosmetic brand Marble Lab. Subscribers are asking to add a second side. Here is Patrick's position. According to him, Nastya Mironova does not “gift” the brand, and as a result she will receive 15-20 million compensation.",2
36,"Hello everyone, this is Jamila. If you noticed, I stopped writing about homemade beauty recipes. The fact is that several colleagues felt that I was promoting homemade cosmetics, and the ingredients may not be safe for different skin types. I really appreciate your trust, and your health, so I immediately froze the rubric. And I took time to think it over. But I want to answer the claims, which are partially justified. All the ingredients of home recipes are only natural (honey, coffee, oil, etc.), tested on me many, many times, and a safe dosage is calculated. But even with all that, anyone can be allergic to any of these ingredients. You can also overdo it with the dosage or harm the skin. But, it seems to me, this also applies to ordinary cosmetic jars from stores. It’s better for you to decide for yourself whether to return the heading “homemade beauty recipes” or not. Poll below",2
37,"Before writing a review on a jar, I always look to see if other beauty bloggers have written about it. I always compare my feelings and results. The main thing is to trust the blogger and know that his reviews are honest. One of the honest bloggers in the beauty segment is Valya @accio_beauty. I met her quite recently. Valya works in the civil service for the first persons of the state during the day, and in the evening ... she writes a review on banks! She has many collections (which I don’t have), tips on caring for the body and hair. An amazing mixture of an official and a beauty blogger. I can say that I even learned about some products from her channel. Like, share https://t.me/accio_beauty",2
38,"My most stylish gloss is Karl Lagerfeld+ModelCo-Lip Light Gloss. A glossy nude in a very stylish bottle in the shape of Karl's bust and illuminated. There is a mirror on the case, f when opened, the backlight lights up. Thanks to this thoughtful design, you can apply gloss anywhere and at any time of the day. Light it up, look in the mirror, and you're done! By the way, the product is vegan - they made it together with the Australian vegan brand ModelCo. The texture is uniformly creamy. It applies well, comfortable to wear, I like to apply it in a thin layer. Moisturizes well, especially with regular use.Verdict: The king is dead, but his cause lives on! Discounted can be found for 1000r ($12)",2
39,"I am not a professional makeup artist, but I love doing make-up from an early age. Today I want to make a review of the cosmetics that I used for the look in the photo. So let's go: -Primer The POREfessional from Benefit (review on the channel) -Foundation foundation Guerlain Parure Gold (review on the channel) -ABH eyebrow pomade (review on the channel) -Contouring Smashbox Step-by-step countour kit -Eyeshadow ABH Jackie Aina+ Smashbox - Vivienne Sabo Cabaret Mascara (Channel Review) - Smashbox Halo Powder (Channel Review) - Inglot Blush - Jeffree Star Highlighter - Jeffree Star Lipstick For some products I have not had time to do a detailed review on the channel, I will fix it soon.",2
40,"Dior's Prestige line will soon release an updated lotion La Lotion Essence de Rose. In the updated lotion, the content of active ingredients has doubled, so, in theory, it can replace serums. The scientists of the brand have found that the skin spends the most resources on self-defense, and it has very few resources left to restore, as well as to absorb the beneficial components of creams and serums (it turns out that they work at half strength). To overcome this, the updated lotion is designed to improve the energy, water and lipid flow in the epidermis, as a result of which all subsequent care will work twice as efficiently. This is all in theory, how in practice - we'll see. The updated lotion Dior Prestige La Lotion Essence de Rose 2020 will be available in Japan from June 5, 2020.",2
41,"Hi all. Today vegan mascara Sephora Size Up Mascara. The first thing that catches your eye is the size. Here as much as 14 ml. Usually manufacturers produce carcasses with a volume of 10-12 ml. Brush. Nylon bristles of different lengths, twisted in a spiral. Convenient to use. Color-ultrablack. And then a complete disappointment. First, it stains the eyelids. Secondly, it is very easy to overdo it, the mascara is applied in a huge amount and as a result the eyelashes stick to each other so that it is difficult to separate. After a few hours, looking at the mirror you see a panda, the ink is peeling off. Verdict: The mascara doesn't even work out its 890 rubles.",2

I do this: I apply powder after foundation and concealer and leave it on for 10 minutes. At this time, the powder is “baked” or, more simply, fixed on the skin. After that, I brush off the excess with a brush. Result: photoshop in real life. The powder has the lightest, weightless texture, dissolves on the skin without a trace.

Another minus, it is problematic to apply to the wings of the nose and areas under the eyes. Verdict: If you want to have Photoshop at hand, then take it.

In short, Coty, which bought the Kylie Cosmetics brand, revealed her true capital. It turned out that the businesswoman Kylie Jenner has about $ 900 million, and she received 340 of them recently from the sale of a stake in the company.

There is a theory that active oxygen molecules - that is, free radicals - are the culprits of premature skin aging. They block the production of collagen and elastin, the skin begins to lose moisture. Hence the appearance of wrinkles and age spots. And to fight such bad things, antioxidants are needed. Our body gets antioxidants from food, but this is not enough. Therefore, you need to get these substances from outside, including from cosmetics. What ingredients in cosmetics contain antioxidants?

Absorbs quickly, does not leave behind stickiness. And then you can already basic care. Verdict: The oil is excellent at fighting dryness and flaking. I personally didn't have any shelves. And the bottle costs only $10, which is very affordable even for The Ordinary.",2
100,"AnsaLigy for you lifting patches with amber granules and serum. Patches that really removed mimic wrinkles and dark circles under the eyes. I'm a little shocked because patches are 90% self-hypnosis. But then manufacturers and technologists somehow picked up a miraculous formula that really works. My mimic wrinkles smoothed out in 20 minutes. Of course, not forever, but if you need to urgently clean up, just apply these patches. I saw how some complained that the patches were slipping, but they seemed to hold on to me. I even ran around the apartment with them after the children, and ok. By the way, it’s better to keep them for 30 minutes. Verdict: the effect is the first time, buy a couple so that they are always at hand as a sos tool. Minus the price, 1 pair costs 390 rubles. But on the other hand, the result is comparable to salon care, so do not save on yourself.",2
101,"Today, a review of two products from the Onme brand at once: the softest foam cleanser and bath salt. So, fluid foam. So delicate that it is suitable for the first stage of cleansing, that is, to wash off the accumulated dust from the face. It won’t clean up to a squeak, it won’t clean black dots. BUT: this cleanser has a wonderful property: to soothe the skin after all the aggressive procedures that we perform with it. After acids, peels, cleansing, rest is needed - just a light cleansing. And here it is. Bath salt with lavender. What I like is the fine grind and added oils. And then you pour sea salt into the bath, and then lie on the rocks. There isn't. It is felt that there are a lot of oils in the product, so the skin becomes very nourished. As if rubbed with a batter. 20 minutes and you will have a home spa. Relaxes and soothes, which is what this jar requires. Verdict: take the foam in case the skin needs a rest from all your manipulations. And bath salts, yes. Yes, and the price tags are not biting: salt 390r, foam-fluid - 490r.",2

106,"I found a replacement for hydrophilic oil on iHerb - this is a cleansing balm. It is suitable for both cleansing and make-up removal. In texture: like a hydrophilic oil, but a little harder and denser. Melts on contact with the warmth of the hands. It turns out an oil that dissolves all the dirt from the face. It is enough to wipe with a damp cloth or rinse. The smell is characteristic of iHerb products: grassy. The balm contains: coconut oil, shea butter, freesia extract, lime extract, jasmine extract. This is a completely natural cleanser, no foam. But look at the tolerance of oils specifically for your skin. How to apply? pick up balm with a spatula. Apply it on DRY skin, massage, then add some water and continue to massage. Well, then we wash everything off our face. In addition to cleansing, the manufacturer promises to even out the skin texture and reduce rashes, but so far I don’t see any sense. Maybe I don't use it much. Verdict: If you love hydrophilic oils in cleansing, then you will love it. The price tag is 1100 rubles.",2

Skin type is determined by the amount of sebum secreted. Let's analyze how to determine the type of skin at home: 1. Cleanse the skin 2. Do not apply anything to the face and wait from 30 minutes to 2 hours. 3. Assess how oily the skin turned out to be. Apply the tissue to different parts of your face. If stains appear on the napkin, then the skin type is considered oily. Combination skin will show itself as dry on the cheeks and oily in the T-zone.

Asian women came up with the idea of ​​shaving before applying cosmetics: in their opinion, without vellus hair, the face looks smoother and younger. Is it true? Stupidity. Yes, due to dermaplaning, horny cells are exfoliated and vellus hair is removed from the surface of the face. BUT! vellus hair grows back within a week, and the effect gradually fades away. Firstly, hair growth is enhanced, and secondly, the growing hair becomes coarser and more pigmented. Thus, dermaplaning is pure aesthetics for the day. The tonal will ideally lay down, and then wait for the beard. Do not repeat, this is ugly. Threading is considered an alternative - removing vellus hair with a thread. The effect lasts longer, since vellus hair is not shaved, but depilated. The procedure is also safer in terms of infection and does not require complete sterility during the procedure. But there is only one conclusion: shaving or depilating facial hair before makeup is crazy. Another issue is the profuse growth of facial hair.",2

It turned out that the emotional state improved not only in those clients who were given injections in the forehead! As scientists say, the mechanism is much more complicated than just smoothing the skin. Botox can be transported to the structure of the central nervous system, and affect mood and emotions!

131,"A review of a very budget Botavikos serum for 300 rubles. Strongly for an amateur, but it came to me. I have been testing for a month, the sensations were initially ambiguous. Let's start with the composition: vegetable oil of jojoba, pomegranate, argan and borage, extracts of rose hips, arnica and rosemary. The composition is 100% natural. Therefore, a very grassy strange smell that not everyone likes. But there are no chemical flavors, and natural flavors - they are. The product is more of an oil than a serum. The consistency is very dense, it is absorbed within 10-15 minutes. At first, as if the skin stops breathing, and it becomes stuffy. And as it is absorbed, the face is very soft, smooth and shines from the inside. This serum is designed to maintain skin tone and elasticity. Of course, you won’t get any anti-aging and cell restoration for 300 rubles. But good hydration and nutrition - yes! Verdict: I would not recommend this serum for every day use. But as a nourishing oil, especially in winter - that's it. It costs 345 rubles.",2

151,"Hi all! Today I will tell you about the king of cosmetic ingredients - Niacinamide. What is it? Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3, also known as nicotinamide. The lack of this vitamin can lead to pellagra - ""disease of three D"" - diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia. It is considered the most studied cosmetic anti-aging ingredient. What is good for the skin? Niacinamide is an antioxidant that evens out the complexion, reduces yellowness, the appearance of wrinkles and hyperpigmentation. Helps retain moisture in the skin, so it is useful for both aging and dry skin. B3 is considered effective for the treatment of problem skin: the skin is less oily, and inflammation is reduced. How to use it? Niacinamide is now included in the composition of creams, masks. I used it in serum format. The effect is cumulative. It is desirable that the% of niacinamide be at least 2-3%.

154,"Golden foil mask with astaxanthim for the face from Dr.Smart by Angel key. No, it's not what you thought. It is not made of gold and not with particles of gold. This is just a two-layer mask, the top layer of which is just gold-colored elastic foil, and the bottom layer is fabric. The foil prevents the essence of the mask from evaporating quickly, and also helps to retain heat. All this enhances the penetration of ingredients. Active ingredients: Astaxanthin and adenosine. They deeply moisturize the skin. Effect: To be honest, it is no different from ordinary tissue. Verdict: A typical deep hydrating sheet mask. If you want variety, you can try. Price: 100 rubles.",2

According to the manufacturer, 15-20 minutes after you have eaten this lollipop, your body will begin to release the flavor. What progress has been made!

The pigment gives a little complicated, the texture is not powdery, but a little harder. Verdict: A good palette for a not very cheap price. The price tag is 5,300 rubles.",2
158,"Caviar in the composition of cosmetics for those who are 35+. Which caviar to choose? Arginine is the main component for which caviar is so valued in cosmetics. It helps cells divide and heal small wounds. For cosmetics, sturgeon caviar is most often chosen. The amino acids contained in it renew cells, slow down aging and strengthen the structure. Also, the antioxidants in caviar prevent the breakdown of collagen and elastin, and also minimize the risk of fine wrinkles. Well, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids give the skin radiance and help build a protective barrier. Experts recommend using ""caviar"" creams, masks and serums starting after 35-40 years old, for skin with the first signs of aging: dryness, creases and wrinkles, age spots. By the way, caviar extract is often added to hair products - it adds shine to them.",2
159,"We continue the theme of cosmetics with an interesting composition. Today, a strange ingredient is ""swallow's nest"". Bird's nests of salangans (they are also called ""swallow's nests"") in China are an expensive delicacy. The houses of these birds consist mostly of twigs and saliva. When cooking, the twigs soften, and something like funchose glass noodles is obtained. It doesn't sound appetizing, but the sprigs contain ""nutricollagen"". According to cosmetologists, this substance, together with amino acids and minerals, rejuvenates the skin, returns a healthy color to the face, and minimizes the appearance of wrinkles. But there is one ""BUT"": the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of such an outlandish ingredient have not yet been fully studied.",2

There are gold glitters, but they are tiny, and give an even and natural glow. How to open and use correctly. You need to twist the upper part - there is a mesh where the pigment is collected. In addition, there is a soft layer on the lid that will absorb all the remnants and excess pigment. So after use, you can just close the lid and not worry that it will crumble. The pigment can be applied on the cheeks and on the eyelids. After application, it becomes not as bright as on the hands. It fades well. I mainly use it as a shadow for every day, it turns out very naturally. Verdict: Comfortable pigment for all occasions. Price: 2,500 R, but can be found at a discount.",2
161,"Bee venom is called a ""Botox substitute"". Why such a loud statement and what does Kate Middleton have to do with it? Bee venom (scientifically ""apitoxin"") has essentially the same properties as honey: antibacterial effect, moisturizing and skin treatment. Dermatologists state that bee venom contains a powerful combination of enzymes, peptides and amino acids. When using cosmetics with these ingredients, you seem to become stung by a bee: blood circulation increases, and the skin secretes collagen more actively. Of course, apitoxin is not as powerful as injections. I would call it ""easy replacement"". By the way, Deborah Mitchell, Kate Middleton's cosmetologist, even created a cosmetic brand based on bee venom cosmetics. It is worth noting that the mechanism by which apitoxin exerts its anti-aging effects is not yet fully understood. And theoretically bee venom is a potential allergen",2

A light pink-bronze shade with small sparkles inside, but when applied, they are not noticeable at all. I liked it, well emphasizes the cheekbones. Both have the same texture. Manufacturers claim this palette as Highlighting Duo, but, of course, there is no smell of highlighter here. Verdict: Nice bronzer for summer. Price tag 3.400 R.",2

It is simply cool: no brushes and troubles are needed. The pigmentation is not bright (I layered it in the photo so that it could be seen), that is, it is difficult to go too far with it.

The brand was also not chosen by chance. The Lip Bar is a vegan makeup brand that is growing in popularity outside of the US.

Judging by the composition, it should have a moisturizing, protective and healing effect (stevia has an antibacterial effect here). The balm has a very refreshing effect: after application, a chill is felt on the lips. The balm itself is colorless, but a barely noticeable blue tint leaves and pales the lips. Therefore, it is more suitable for lips with a pink tint. Verdict: Winter is coming and it's time to stock up, so take it. Price: 1,390 R",2

At the same time, you will not even get the right to choose the color and fragrance - each bar of soap will be a surprise from the designer. Such a price tag due to a complex technological process. First, in one of the museums in Los Angeles, a nose was carved from wood - an exact copy of the nose of George Washington, modeled on a bust. Then a smaller copy of the nose was created from elastic foam. This form, with other soap-making tools, gave life to unusual soapy noses.",2
169,"About the ""friend of your youth"" - vitamin F. And how to find it in the composition of skin care cosmetics? A bit of science. Firstly, vitamin F is a fatty acid: 1) Linoleic protects cells from the effects of pathogenic bacteria, adapts cells to stress and adverse conditions, helps retain moisture in the skin and is involved in the anti-inflammatory process. Studies have confirmed that linoleic acid helps get rid of acne. 2) Arachidonic (omega-6) - important for the production of prostaglandins, which, according to experts, prevent dermatitis due to an inflammatory reaction. What can vitamin F deficiency lead to? The skin loses its ability to retain moisture and defend itself against pathogens. F deficiency symptoms: Dry skin, eczema, rough knees, elbows, exfoliating brittle nails, acne, pimples on the body and face, as well as dermatitis and psoriasis . Where to look for vitamin F in the composition of cosmetics? In nourishing, moisturizing creams, facial oils and is found in sheet masks. In skin care products, vitamin F is commonly referred to as linoleic acid.",2

And about vitamin F, I told you in detail above. Effect: Well, he did not remove the black dots, of course. And did not clean the pores deeply. But it moisturized perfectly, the face, as they say, shone from the inside. There is a lot of essence inside the bag, enough for 2 times.

It dries quickly on the lips, the finish is matte, the durability is very high (however, after a full meal, the middle fades faster), leaves no traces anywhere. But make-up removal is complicated. And the marker dries out the lips a bit. And now about the balm. It has a soft and nourishing texture, softens and nourishes the lips.

182,"If you have a roller gathering dust in your closet, like my girlfriend, after this post, you will definitely go looking for it. Girls, everything is simple here. The roller works on the principle of a conventional massager: it stimulates blood flow, helps the cream penetrate deeper into the layers of the skin, and also smoothes wrinkles. Tested on myself: a 10-minute massage refreshes the complexion, gives radiance. And in some cases, it helps to fight post-acne. There are two types of roller: jade and rose quartz. The difference between the two is that the former stays cool all the time, while jade is adaptive in nature and tends to heat up when in contact with the skin. Jade rollers are more expensive, it is a very soft stone that tends to “wear out”, so a rose quartz roller will last longer .How to use it correctly? First, you can not roll the roller on a dry face. Before the procedure, you need to cleanse your face, apply oil or cream - then the roller will increase the effectiveness of care. The movements should be along the massage lines of the face. If the face has turned pink, then you are doing everything right. The procedure can be carried out in the morning and in the evening - it should take no more than 10 minutes.",2

203,"Probably everyone knows that scrubs and peels cannot be used daily. What happens if you ignore this recommendation? Let's see.1. Weakens the protective barrier.

Increases the risk of sunburn. Then the skin not only turns red, but can also become covered with blisters and crusts 4. Provokes early wrinkles. Excessive exfoliation makes the skin thinner and more dehydrated, leading to earlier wrinkles over time. 5. Provokes a feeling of tightness. Due to the weakened protective barrier, microcracks and trauma, a feeling of dryness and tightness of the skin appears. And here you can’t help with ordinary creams - you will have to contact a cosmetologist-dermatologist. Therefore, it’s not just that they write on the packages that peels and scrubs can be used 1-2 times a week. There was a theoretical rubric from Jamila with you.",2

Allegedly, it is possible to ""accustom"" hair to a rare wash and ""retrain"" oily scalp so that it releases less sebum. Girls, all these are ""grandmother's tales"" and ""bad"" advice that have no basis. The work of the sebaceous glands depends on hormones. If a person has oily facial skin, then most likely the scalp will have the same type. Inherited genetically. Or it manifests itself with some hormonal disorders. Also, this problem appears during puberty. So how often should you wash your hair? If you clean oily skin less often, then it will not become easier for her. Sebum will accumulate on the surface of the skin and will clog pores, respectively, preventing the release of a new portion of fat.

During the night, the work of the sebaceous glands leaves a film that must be cleaned after waking up. Often use exfoliating products (washing with acids and a scrubbing effect).

396,"What is the fundamental difference between alginate masks and ordinary ones? The basis of the alginate mask is alginate salt or sodium alginate. Derived from sea brown algae, this component is rich in minerals, vitamins and other nutrients, and is also able to bind a huge number of water molecules, that is, it is very similar in properties to hyaluronic acid. That's it. Thanks to alginate, the auxiliary components of the mask (hyaluron, collagen, vitamins, etc.) penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and provide a much better result than in the format of other masks. This is, girls, the main difference. These masks are often called modeling, since the gel formed from the alginate mixture is plasticized in a few minutes and forms a dense film on the skin. It tightens the contours of the face while the components of the mask penetrate the skin. Any type of alginate mask effectively heals and moisturizes the skin, improves blood circulation in cells, tightens pores, reduces swelling and soothes the skin after aggressive procedures.",2

The consistency is tender, like butter, quite a bit is enough for the procedure. The composition is rich in oils: orange, apricot kernel oil, canola, babassu seeds, ylang-ylang and cedar. After contact with water, the oil turns into milk. It is washed off without problems, leaving a little greasy after itself, but this is the norm, since this is the first stage of cleansing. My impressions: the balm perfectly dissolves makeup, cleanses pores, I don’t feel tightness on the skin. Verdik: A good hydrophilic balm, but if given the choice, my hands will still reach for Heimish. Price: 2.500 R",2

Its brush is silicone, the size of the bristles increases towards the end. Bends 120 degrees, which, according to manufacturers, is convenient for application. Ingredients: jojoba oil and collagen. It is also hypoallergenic. My opinion: The bendable brush does not play any role and does not facilitate the application of mascara, that is, this is purely a marketing ploy to attract attention with a design. It is applied unevenly, somewhere more, and somewhere less. After application, the cilia stick together, it is difficult to separate them. Yes, it lengthens perfectly, but there is not enough volume, the cilia seem very thin and long. And if you apply in 2 layers, you get ""spider legs"". The durability is good. The make-up remover is easy to remove with micellar water. Verdict: A mascara that has great design and marketing. But not the product itself. Price 820 R.",2

Doesn't dry out the skin. The finish is matte and velvety at the same time. If you type a little on the brush, then the coverage is light.

I hope I don’t need to remind you that in the summer you don’t need to go out without SPF, and if you use “C”, then categorically only with sunscreen.

This is a conscious consumption in the field of beauty, the use of organic products and saving resources. On cosmetics, you should look for the Cruelty Free label and the Moebius Loop eco-label - a sign of recycling. Quick procedures that give an instant but short-lived effect: manicure, keratin, lamination, Botox, beauty injections, can worsen the condition of the skin, hair, nails. Supporters of slow beauty suggest not chasing a quick result, but instead focusing on natural and high-quality care. Without haste. That is, such concepts as express spa, SOS masks and any intervention with a quick effect should be excluded. The author of this trend is the writer and founder of the SpaRitual brand Shel Pink, she spoke about this in her book - ""Slow Beauty"".",2

This is a problem for the industry as a whole: there are American and European brands that have not confirmed their spf label. For many, this problem may not seem very serious, in fact it is not. There are people for whom spf is simply vital: for people with cancer or skin diseases. Therefore, my advice to you: always take spf products from trusted brands.",2
432,"We are used to ceramides in cosmetics. But why are they needed? Ceramides are just a type of fat. And the main structural element of the hydrolipid layer of the skin. Ceramides fill the intercellular space and protect against external factors. And they also act as a kind of ""deciders"": which cells should die, and which ones should remain. When does the balance of ceramides break down? First, it happens with age. Secondly, from improper care and the environment (frost or sun). Signs of a lack of ceramides: - dehydration - dryness - irritation and inflammation. As it has already become clear, ceramides are essentially additional fats that help restore the skin. There are 9 types of ceramides, which are marked with numbers from 1 to 9. The ceramides that make up the cream should fit well into the hydrolipid layer of our skin and fill the voids.",2

444,"I love cleansing gadgets. After FOREO, I started looking for more budget and simple options. I tried from the Korean brand WellDerma Cleansing fish. And here are my breakdowns. He is silicone. The bristles are thin and short. The effect of the brush is like a scrub, that is, it does not clean very deeply. You can do a massage with a ponytail and scales. A fat minus is its vibration: it is very strong when I massage it on my face. Especially in the part of the chin, I feel this vibration throughout the skull, which is very unpleasant. What is the result? I realized that rather than spending money and nerves on incomprehensible gadgets, it’s better to buy a good one once. I tried to find an analogue of FOREO, but, alas, the experiment failed. Verdict: A gadget that doesn't do its job and delivers an unpleasant experience. Price 1.700 R",2
445,"My beautician recommends gouache massage. And I - to you. Why is he so popular? The word ""guasha"" itself consists of two parts: ""gua"" - a scraper, ""sha"" - redness of the skin. It has been known since the Stone Age. At that time, the scraper was used to rub parts of the body to relieve pain symptoms. And he gained real popularity due to Chinese medicine. Well, here is the merit of beauty bloggers. A tool for carrying out a beauty procedure is made of jade, agate, wood, horn or bone. And its shape resembles the paw of an animal. What gives massage with this stone ""paw""? - restores the correct lymph flow in the tissues of the face and removes its stagnation. So you can remove puffiness. - highlights the contours of the face: you can make the cheekbones clearer, and the double chin - less. Guasha massage technique is a delicate matter. It's important to do it right. There are a lot of videos on the Internet, and courses on Instagram. Who won't fit? If you have on your face: rosacea, rosacea, herpes in the acute stage, acne and spot rashes, then gouache massage is not recommended. Also, you can not do it in the case of SARS.",2

447,"The reckless way is very strong. It all depends on which concealer and which cream, because the cream has every chance to corrode the concealer. Or it won’t be absorbed at all if the concealer is persistent and fixed. You know my method. Cream, let it completely (!) Absorb Next, a thin layer of concealer and if you need to add, then add not a full layer, but only pointwise to where the concealer blocked the problem completely. It is worth fixing the concealer. Ideally, not something strongly matting (so as not to dry out and emphasize facial expressions) Better than something illuminating. My favorites right now are veil by hourglass and setting powder by Laura Mercier. And also definitely THIN, just veily. No real life baking, in general, you get the idea.",2
448,"Looks like the beauty industry is experiencing a cartoon-themed boom. Princesses, unicorns, sequins and other children's motifs are increasingly found in the design of beauty products. It's all about marketing: buyers' nostalgia for childhood brings companies a good income. For example, cosmetics with princesses impose subconscious associations: if an adult buys and uses such a product, he feels young at heart. Only recently collaborations with cartoons have been made by: Morphe x Lisa Frank; ColourPop x Barbie (Barbie in Malibu); MAC x Cruella; Estée Lauder X Disney (perfume with Princess Ariel). And the TooFaced brand regularly releases cosmetic sets with unicorns, rainbows and teddy bears for those who love cuteness in everything.",2

If it were not for the allergy to honey, I would have taken it for sure.",2
450,"Some ladies replace their daily moisturizer with baby cream, but how right is that? Let's take a look. Yes, baby cream is safe, hypoallergenic, contains enough nutrients and vitamins. BUT! Children's cream is a product designed to protect children's skin. It aims to lower the Ph level. In adults, the acid-base balance is different from that of children, it is underestimated, therefore, if you use it constantly, it will definitely harm your skin. There is another reason. Due to the dense texture and components in the composition, the cream does not allow adult skin to breathe. Unlike adults, babies' skin breathes and develops more actively. Thus, a film is created on the surface, which leads to the greenhouse effect and clogging of the pores. Baby cream is suitable for thin skin around the eyes, if you have it too dry, it will eliminate the problem if you do not use it constantly. Verdict: Not everything childish is good for adults. Chanterelle cream can seriously spoil your skin. But the heels - please, smear as much as you like",2

For example, Hermès Beauty and Pat McGrath Labs did this. By the way, there are a lot of ideas for a pink blush now.

455,"Do you really need a refrigerator for cosmetics? Some products (sheet masks, patches, vitamin C, body cream, massage gadgets, eye cream) are best cooled in the refrigerator before use. But whether a separate device is needed for this is a moot point. The fact is that our jars are made at room temperature, it is enough to store them in a dark cabinet (with the exception of organic cosmetics and packages that have the inscription ""store in the refrigerator""). Too cold cream can also be harmful, especially for people with inflammation on the skin, not everyone likes temperature changes. That is, there is no urgent need for it. I think it will be useful only for Instagram photos, for the interior of the room, and it is also good for traveling.",2

But in general, there are many recipes for making masks with red clay for various skin problems. I will experiment",2

It's simple: - First, I clean my face to a squeak to reduce sebum production - I have combination skin, so I do clay masks 2 times a week so that the sebaceous glands work normally (you can use white and black clay) - Creams I use it with the lightest possible texture. — For matting, I always have napkins with me. And before applying the powder, I always blot my skin with them, then apply the powder. BUT: only colorless, so as not to create a mask effect. - I use a primer, I apply it on my lips, so the lipstick lasts longer.",2

478,"It's time to scribble a couple of lines about a beautiful tan. And how to keep it. The tips are simple but important. 1. Prepare the skin. As well as before makeup, you need to exfoliate it before leaving (belongings to help you) 2. An even tan depends on how well the skin is moisturized. Since the salty sea and the chlorinated water of the pool dry the skin, it is necessary to moisturize the skin before leaving for the beach. 3. Do not be lazy to use after-sun products (it can be shower gels, soothing lotions, mousses and balms, cooling cream-gels, oils) to soothe the skin after prolonged sun exposure. They will help prolong the effect of tanning. 4. After tanning, do not use scrubs and cosmetics with acids (they will provoke early peeling of the skin and the tan will wash off faster). Take a cool shower, because during heating, dead cells disappear faster. But, of course, it is very difficult to get an absolutely even tan on the whole body. And there are no hacks here. My shoulders and nose darkened more than the rest of my body.",2
479,"We continue the hot topic about tanning. Today's review is Mixit's after-sun oils. Let's go: 1.Deep tanning product with coconut oil and acai berry extract. The consistency is very liquid, spreads easily, absorbs quickly, does not leave much stickiness. Protects from UV rays. I applied it up to 15-20 minutes of exposure to the sun and renewed it after contact with water. The product itself is not bad, BUT I advise it only to dark-skinned women, I do not recommend sunbathing with oils for white-skinned people, the likelihood of getting a sunburn is high (oil under the sun is very hot and can burn light skin). 2. Soothing and revitalizing after-sun oil. Ingredients: almond oil, macadamia oil, lavender essential oil complex, mint extracts. Really soothes the skin. The only thing is absorbed for a long time, in the evening it is necessary to wash it off. Verdict: Oils that are not for everyone: I advise whites to bypass the shelves with this tanner, and after-sun oil is not very comfortable to use",2
480,"Another 10 years and high-quality domestic beauty brands will push foreign leaders out of the market. My latest discovery is the Russian departure of ATLE SKIN. To begin with, a very correct approach: when you enter the site, you take a test survey, answer questions, and then you are sent (to watsap\telegram) an individual ritual. That is, experts on your profile make up the products that your skin needs. I was advised to introduce vitamin C into my ritual. I chose HYDRATE + GLOW FACE OIL with vitamin C from them. The composition is as follows: Jojoba oil (nourishes and moisturizes ), vitamin C and turmeric oil (natural antiseptic, evens complexion). After application, the serum is absorbed immediately, does not leave behind stickiness, oiliness. Doesn't clog pores. And the result is cumulative, you can notice after 3 weeks.

481,"Matcha tea can not only be drunk, but also poured into masks. How do I do it. And as practiced in Asia. This is because matcha contains vitamins C and E, removes toxins from the skin, smoothes mimic wrinkles, evens out skin tone, increases skin elasticity and turgor, reduces inflammation, fights pigmentation, protects against harmful UV rays, and fights against increased skin oiliness. For cosmetology, it is sold in powder form and can be added anywhere (in masks, balms, creams, scrubs, etc.) At one time I used matcha for homemade clay masks. The effect is cool: the skin tone has noticeably evened out, acne has become less. But regularity is important here, girls.",2

After application, after 2-3 minutes, the lipstick sets and becomes matte. But it dries completely in 10-15 minutes. They promise us durability for 8 hours, but no.

Its camera recognizes all imperfections in skin tone, determines where and what needs to be hidden, that is, it sort of seals imperfections. Thus, the foundation does not cover the entire face, and the makeup looks extremely natural. You might think that this is Photoshop in real life. According to the manufacturers, the pigment that is applied to the face contains Serum (Spot Optimizing Serum), which, with prolonged use, reduces the visibility of age spots. In theory, of course, everything sounds good. But I doubt it: skin and pigmentation problems are different, so some gadget, alas, cannot directly photoshop you. But since such technologies have appeared, it means that we will soon see more analogues, perhaps more advanced ones. The cost of the gadget is $599, and the cartridge is $100.",2

My result: moisturizing is very good, I apply it in the morning and there is no feeling of dryness for the whole day. But the wrinkles are in place, of course. Verdict: excellent moisturizing serum for the skin around the eyes, worth its 6.540 R. Like all Kenzo products that I have tried --",2

629,"The next trend after crystals for the face and black lipstick is purple blush, which is the shade of the year Very Peri according to Pantone. The trend has already gone viral on TikTok. The main thing here is to choose the right color for your skin tone. Owners of fair skin will suit a blush with a pale or lavender tint, for medium tones, a pure purple color is better, and for the most tanned and swarthy, mauve. Looks good, but still I'm on the side of the classics.",2

631,"One of a kind, the only one in the world. Bvlgari presented a perfume bottle made of Murano glass, rose gold and gems. This is the only thing to admire on the eve of the holiday: The bottle is inspired by high jewelry. Gold neck, malachite cap, diamond logo The fragrance, presented in a precious bottle, was created by the famous master perfumer Daniela Andrier. The cost is not written anywhere, because this little thing is priceless",2
632,"A mask with which you can enter the New Year. Kenzoki Youth Flow, night, restorative. Despite the fact that the texture is not light, the cream is comfortable: it will not stick to the pillow. Does not make the face greasy in the morning and does not clog pores. The skin looks rested and fresh, and the tone is even. I use it 2 times a week, after routine care instead of a cream. The composition of this line is the same: water and oil extract of the sacred lotus flower; mallow extract. Verdict: This overnight mask is one of my favorites. Price 8.320 R.",2

634,"The year of the tiger according to the eastern calendar has not yet begun, but already, I see that brands are showing capsules with the main animal print of 2022. Therefore, we are preparing, here are ideas on how to paint nails like a tigress. By the way, the tiger print is not only about brown tones. In fact, you can try different variations: blue, pink, blue, black and white, lavender. And my favorite is still stickers with delicate, nude shades or a jacket with a tiger print.",2
635,"Chanel presented a spring collection dedicated to Gabrielle Chanel's villa La Pausa, located in France in the mountains of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. The collection includes: lip balm, eye shadow palette, blush, liquid eye shadow, highlighter stick. The shades are natural, earthy, and the embossing on the powder is like the rays of the sun falling into Mademoiselle's house. Indeed, in spring, La Pausa is flooded with sunlight typical of the south of France. In general, a beautiful and very spring collection.",2
636,"Although I go for a pedicure in a timely manner, this does not negate additional heel care at home for me. I tried the recently sensational Epil Profi foot gel for pedicure. The composition is: 50% urea, aloe vera, sodium hydroxide, glycerin. I don’t know why it is called a gel, the consistency is actually watery. The smell is very pungent. I use it like this: I saturate cotton pads with the product and put it on my heels, wait a couple of minutes, rub it lightly with pumice stone (the key word is “slightly”) and smear myself with cream. I like the result: the heels are smooth and moisturized. Verdict: if you are too lazy for a pedicure, I recommend it. Price 1.700 R",2
637,"Well, I finally found the perfect eyeliner - Dear Dahlia paradise dream precision pro liquid eyeliner. I have shades: Noir and Mahongany (brown and black). The whole secret is in the app. Manufacturers were able to find that very middle ground: it is not thin, but not thick either. It turns out cool arrows even with me. Longevity is good and will last all night. The color does not fade or fade. Verdict: eyeliner for dream shooters. Price: 3.170 R",2
638,"Lancome has released a triple serum. They call it that because it contains 3 formulas, and each of them is in a different ""chamber"". Different textures come out of three dispensers at once, they need to be mixed and applied to the face. The serum goes like an anti-aging serum. Manufacturers promise wow effect. There are 3 ingredients: new generation hyaluronic acid, vitamin C derivatives + niacinamide, ferulic acid. We will try. But so far, no serum has erased the wrinkles from my face. Well, in general, I perceive the triple whey as a marketing ploy: why pour the ingredients into different vessels, so that you can then mix them in your hands? To have a sense of product innovation?",2
639,"Reverse arrows (or as they are also called - ""cat"") - this year's trend. We often saw them at fashion weeks. So grab a selection. They fit any shape of the eyes, the main thing is to draw carefully. If you're a handy-ass like me, makeup artists recommend starting with creamy textured eyeshadows to get your hands full. By the way, correcting cat arrows is much easier than regular ones.",2
640,"Dior has unveiled a new makeup palette inspired by the famous Miss Dior fragrance. There are 3 shades of eye shadow, lipstick with a satin finish, blush, glitter nail polish and a double ended brush. And there is a case in the format of a clutch with a chain, it looks very nice. This is especially good for travel. But the price tag bites a little - $ 150",2
641,"Dua Lipa always surprises with her hairstyle, this time she made a “graffiti” on her hair: she dyed the light strands with orange airbrushed hearts. I guess Dua Lipa's hairstyle will become a trend soon. For me, this is a bit of a teenage style, which, by the way, is often popularized by the singer. But it looks instagrammable. Of course, it is better to use washable paint here so as not to harm the hair once again.",2
642,"Oriflame THE ONE “Irresistible Touch” lipstick cushion. The sponge is soft and distributes the product well. The texture of the lipstick is light and creamy. The finish is glossy. Smells like berries. To get a rich color, you need 2 layers. But I do this: I apply lipstick, remove the excess with a napkin and touch up with a lip contour, it turns out naturally. Verdict: A good option for daily makeup.",2
643,"If you think that the condition of your teeth does not affect the appearance of wrinkles, then you are greatly mistaken. For example, if your chewing teeth are damaged, then with impaired chewing function, the tone of the facial muscles is also disturbed, which leads to the appearance or aggravation of wrinkles. And I read about this on the channel of Maria, an orthodontist. The channel is incredibly useful for me, especially for those who are already over 30, you must admit that with age, we have more problems with teeth. Maria reveals all the secrets: is bleaching harmful, what kind of whitening is better at home, why does she not like aligners, is it necessary to wear braces before installing veneers, and many other interesting questions. Take a look will be helpful.",2
644,"We forget about ice cubes with cucumbers, we stock up on “ice globes”. On TikTok, the ""iceglobes"" hashtag has already racked up millions of views. This is a new gadget in the form of a glass flask or a roller massager. Must be refrigerated before use. The effect is the same as that of the cubes (they remove swelling and fatigue under the eyes), but there is a slight difference: they are, of course, more comfortable to use. It is recommended to use after cream or serum. The accessory costs on the Internet from a thousand rubles to infinity. Before spending money, think: maybe free cubes after all?",2
645,"And now about my sore spot - that is, about my hair. Every winter their condition happens like this: they become electrified, become brittle and drier. Care must be taken carefully. This time I took Elseve oil from L’Oréal Paris with 6 oils of rare colors. The consistency is a little thick enough for 2-3 pumps. The fragrance is unreal, brings back thoughts to the sea and the sunny beach. Pros: Doesn't weigh hair down or make it greasy. They are soft, nourished, silky, easy to comb and even mask split ends. There are 2 options for use: apply to wet ends or use as a mask before shampooing. I like the first option more. Verdict: Must-have for a winter shelf. Tembole is now on sale, we have time to order the girls.",2
646,"Finally, Givenchy Beauty has a creative director. The chair has been empty since the summer when the charismatic Nicolas Degennes left. This place was taken by a young but ambitious makeup artist Tom Walker. He will now be responsible for the development of the brand's beauty products and cosmetic collections, as well as for the implementation of advertising campaigns. Tom has created makeup for photosets of magazines such as i-D, AnOther, W Magazine and Dazed and Confuse. I think the fashion house appreciated Tom's creativity: his work is inspired by architecture and the fashion world. As you can see, he loves lighting effects and bold shades in images. And it's very interesting to look at Walker's campaigns now. Once Nicolas Degenne breathed new life into Givenchy makeup, it was he who created the top products that made the brand's cosmetics really cool. 20 years of producing cool products is not a bug sneezed. But the market needs change. And now everyone has high expectations from the new creative director.",2
647,"As an administrator of a beauty channel, I am interested in the behind the scenes of the cosmetics market: where do new banks come from, why do they cost so much, what promises of manufacturers cannot be trusted. Recently stuck on the @Beauty_AD channel. And this is a godsend for those who want to keep abreast of the secrets of the market, statistics, trends of the future and the present, and interesting new products. Anna touches on very interesting topics, for example: is it normal to sell for $40 a product that costs $5, (yes, in some cases it is justified ); how to recognize greenwashing (environmental friendliness for show); and the topic why the status of clean beauty does not mean usefulness deserves special attention. In short, girls, highley recommended. And I'll leave the link here: https://t.me/Beauty_AD",2
648,"In addition to brindle nails, “mirror nails” are gaining popularity this year. By the way, I have seen such a design from celebrities more than once. And here are the ideas with a mirror finish that are currently being practiced: you can do it as a design on just a few nails, a jacket like Megan Fox’s, or a plain coating like Gigi Hadid’s. Here I will not be modest and admit that in this case I like bright and evocative shades.",2
649,"Mascara with bristles of different lengths and a life hack on how to use it. OK BEAUTY Color salute push & curl. On one side, the bristles are short, their purpose is to give volume. I use this side in the first step to paint over the roots. On the second side it is longer: they can separate adhering cilia and conveniently tint the lower ones. These bristles are originally designed to make lashes longer. This mascara has a couple more advantages: - the limiter will perform its function with a bang, no extra product on the brush. - the durability is good, it does not crumble and does not flow. - make-up remover is light, can be washed off with foam. But I also found disadvantages: - the eyelid always gets dirty. - when applied in several layers, it gives the effect of a ""spider web"". In general, one layer is enough for daily makeup. Verdict: good mascara for its 690 rubles, so you can close your eyes to small jambs",2
650,"A haircut that suits everyone is a “cascade” (hair stylists also call it “shag”). A hairstyle from the 90s that is back in trend. It is especially relevant for those who want to change their image, but it is a pity to touch the length of their hair. Plus, it helps to visually correct the shape of the face and increase the volume of hair. In my opinion, this hairstyle is especially good for curls: it will give the effect of airiness and, most importantly, it will facilitate the daily styling process. For example, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, Kaia Gerber cut their hair under the ""cascade"".",2
651,"Another unsafe beauty hack from tik tok. This time they offer to make smokey ice with a lip pencil to save time. The process is as follows: apply a lip liner to the eyelid, blend and fix with a bronzer. I tried, yes, it worked, but it did not save me time. What is the harm? Firstly, you must definitely take a pencil with a greasy texture in order to blend easily and not harm the thin skin of the eyelids. Secondly, it is not sterile: the pencil can contain bacteria that live in the oral cavity, and - hello, allergies.",2
652,"The holidays are behind us, which means that all stocks of patches and masks have been exhausted. As everyone knows, my must-have are Ansaligy patches. I went to the site to update my stock, and then there is a Cyber ​​Monday promotion, which means it's time to take as much as possible. And the essence of the promotion is this: the more items in the basket, the greater the discount. For example, when buying one product - a 20% discount on the entire order, when buying two products - 25%, when buying three or more products - 30%. I think it's a great offer. The discount applies to all products without exception, except for my favorite patches, I managed to grab a couple of jars of serums and hair care. Girls, I suggest not to miss the chance. Just in case, I leave the link here.",2
653,"This product from Dear Dahlia honestly disappointed me. Automatic eyebrow pencil DEAR DAHLIA perfect brow longwear sculpting pencil, shade ""chestnut"". Firstly, the pigmentation is weak: to get the color, you need to go through several layers. Secondly, the pencil is too dry, it is difficult to paint and blend. Verdict: I recommend this pencil for owners of thick eyebrows who just need to slightly tweak the shape. Others with this product will lose their last hair while trying to draw something, traumatizing their skin with a dry pencil. Price 2.860 R",2
654,"I, a person who has always been on the side of minimalism, now look at manicures with bright and unusual designs. What do they say? The pandemic has changed our tastes from head to toe. And by the way, if you think that it is impossible to create nail art on short nails, then you are mistaken. And this collection is proof of that. This is a design from the studio of Elvira Safina, which I liked. And for those who quickly get bored with bright art, I advise you to make it on one hand, and simply paint the other in one tone.",2
655,"Reverse ""cat"" arrows - the main beauty touch on the Dior couture show. The brand's creative director of make-up, Peter Philips, refreshed the trendy make-up with a color - the arrows were white. Looks beautiful not only for the podium. They visually increase the size of the eyes. Therefore, they are ideal for owners of Asian eyes. It also looks great on dark skin.",2
656,"Unexpectedly, makeup from the Chanel show is discussed as much as clothes. The brand drew with models not only black arrows, but ""black eyes"" in the floor of the face. To be honest, knowing how Maria Grazia Chiuri loves to use the theme of feminism, I prepared myself for the social overtones. But it turned out that this is an homage to meiku from the 1920s and was inspired by the work of the avant-garde artists of that era. Look at the dramatic smokes the ladies had at the time! It actually looks nice up close. Yes Yes. Look at the last photo. It's just that this is the case when the idea could not be completed to the end, and on the podium under different lighting, everything turned stupidly into a bruise. By the way, remember this make-up, you can repeat it on Halloween.",2
657,"This is the second year Givenchy has been releasing solid perfume in the form of a stick, like lipstick. Last year the case was red. In the updated pale pink ""bottle"" - a floral-woody fragrance. A very convenient format: when perfume can be carried even in your pocket. The main thing is to be as persistent as in a classic bottle.",2
658,"It is impossible to pass by the inky eye makeup of Kanye's new passion - Julia Fox. He became her calling card. And the subject of ridicule. For example, Fox has already received the nickname ""raccoon"". Julia herself posted in the story how West personally tints her eyes with black. I can easily believe that this is his idea. By a ""fatal"" coincidence, we saw a similar make-up at the Chanel show. I hope Kanye's companion does not become a beauty trendsetter. It seems that this is what the outrageous rapper and designer is trying to achieve.",2

660,"Traditionally, brands are in a hurry to cash in on lovers. This opportunity, of course, was not missed by the first woman with 300 million followers on Instagram. Kylie Jenner released a collection with hearts for February 14th. Here: an eyeshadow palette, a highlighter, a set of lacquer lip glosses, blush sticks, two sets of matte lipstick and lip pencil. Everything a woman needs to be happy. And the man who will give it. In fact, these heart-shaped packages remind me of sets of children's cosmetics. Although infantilism is now in trend, it does not look solid.",2
661,"I talked about the 3D lipstick printer from Saint Laurent, which is able to repeat any shade of lipstick. Bloggers managed to test it, and here is the main summary. The gadget did not live up to expectations: it does not print a full-fledged lipstick, it just mixes the shades that we “insert”. In fact, it functions as a lipstick palette. Girls, well, we have hands, we can mix ourselves. And save $300 for something really cool.",2
662,"We recolor Christmas trees into hearts. Remember, Valentine's Day is just around the corner. Everything is simple here - we are experimenting with the shape and color of the main symbol of love. Catch romantic ideas",2
663,"Lately I've been using Dior FOREVER SKIN GLOW FLUID SPF 35 foundation, shade N1. The consistency is fluid, that is, liquid. The main thing: it just perfectly evens out the tone. It spreads and blends right away, and works best with a damp sponge. Does not oxidize, adapts to skin tone. Doesn't dry out or clog pores. The finish is natural, the face does not turn into a greasy pancake, but it shines. Verdict: a cool tone for every day for those who do not have global skin problems. Price 4.000 R.",2
664,"I reviewed the make-up from the show of Yulia Yanina, who closed the couture fashion week in Paris. And I was convinced that white arrows will still become the main trend of this year. Here the make-up is almost like on the Dior show, but more expressive. In addition to white eyeliner, ordinary arrows and shadows (brown) were used to visually make the eyes larger. And most importantly, you can repeat the makeup yourself, everything is easy and simple.",2
665,"Introducing the latest ""baby"" from my collection of Anastasia Beverly Hills palettes, from blogger Carli Bybel. She chose the name of each shade herself. For example, Mandala is the sister's nickname, and Libra is Carly's zodiac sign. There are 14 shades (5 mattes, 1 satin, 1 duochrome, 1 satin with glitter, 1 metallic with large shimmer and 5 regular shimmers). The top row is colder shades, and the bottom row is warmer (I prefer it for everyday makeup). And for the evening, my favorite is ""My Angels"". The pigmentation and longevity is excellent, like all ABH shadows. The only thing is that matte shades crumble when shading, and shimmer shades are poorly typed on a brush (I apply them with my finger). Verdict: Not a bad palette, but Modern Renaissance is still my favorite of the ABH eyeshadows. Price: 4,600 R.",2
666,"Continuing the theme of fashion shows, the jewelry was on the level! I am pleasantly surprised that there is one jewelry brand that creates ultra-trend jewelry with precious stones for every day and for special occasions in a beautiful showroom in Moscow. And in their channel they also tell you what you need to know about stones before purchase and show moments of production. At the very least, addictive!",2
667,"Valentine's Day isn't Halloween, but red lipstick and calm eye makeup don't have to be. Catch interesting options. For example, hearts are easy to draw, they will look appropriate, romantic and instagrammable. Also at this year's haute couture weeks there were many inspiring examples that you can repeat at home.",2
668,"Eyeliner from the creators of the best-selling mascara - Vivien Sabo. Shade - 03, Chocolat (brown). I'll start with the positives. The brush is felt, a little hard, very convenient for me (the arrows are accurate). The shade is gorgeous, perfect for everyday makeup. Minuses. Here I want to put exclamation points after each. 1. After drying, the eyeliner cracks. 2. Persistence is below average: crumbles or smears after a few hours. 3. Stings eyes. 4. On the shadow lies terribly. The brush leaves voids behind it: to get a normal arrow, you need to walk at least 2 times. Verdict: If you think that this brand's eyeliner is as good as their mascara, you'd be wrong. Not even worth its 360 rubles",2
669,"I continue to search and test hair care products, and finally I tried the sensational Tik-Tok star - Elseve Lamellar Care from L’Oreal Paris, which also appeared on our market! The texture is liquid like water. I use it like this: for my hair I need about 20-30 ml of the product, I apply it to wet hair along the length (without touching the roots) after shampoo and massage for about 8 seconds, rinse it off. The effect is unexpected: you don’t need to comb your hair, even my curly hair has untangled, it’s shiny, silky, styling is not needed. In a word, we get the effect of light lamination and looks like after a salon. Verdict: A great solution for the busy or a little lazy, instant styling is ready without any extra effort. By the way, a cool gift for February 14 to your beloved.",2

And their first work for the brand was the campaign of the new Lash Clash Extreme Volume mascara. India is known not only for the role of Angel Evangelista in Ryan Murphy's Pose. She (he) is a transgender actress (actor) and uses the gender non-binary pronouns They, Them, Theirs (“they”, “them”), that is, she identifies herself as a non-binary person. Collaborations like this have always worked, and YSL beauty beautifully wants to reach even more audiences.",2
675,"As without lip care in winter. I tried Revolution with avocado oil (I Heart Revolution Tasty Avocado Lip Oil). The texture is medium density and thick, almost like lip gloss. Applied evenly, does not run over the contour. Although the product is oil-based, it is not too greasy, so it is convenient to apply it at night: it is absorbed after 15-20 minutes. The aroma is pleasant, disappears a couple of minutes after application. Result: lips are nourished and moisturized, do not peel off, I especially like how lipsticks go after it. Verdict: lip care 5 out of 5. Price 700 R.",2
676,"Many have already taken advantage of the popularity of the series ""Euphoria"", including the make-up artist of the series Donnie Davy. She recently announced that she was launching her own line of cosmetics. Why not, many are delighted with the makeup of the heroines. I guess the fans are going to sell like hot cakes. Davy says she has been working on the brand for two years, with the creators of Euphoria and the A24 film studio. And she called the brand Half Magic. The products themselves have not yet been shown, but most likely everything will be bright and with glitters.",2
677,"Recently, my hair has been falling wildly, I have been taking vitamins and, plus, I decided to try anti-hair loss products. I started with the Ducray Anaphase shampoo. The texture is creamy but lathers well. Herbal aroma. Active substances: vitamins B5, B6 and B8 (provoke intensive hair growth); a combination of vitamin E with B3 (stimulates the blood circulation of the scalp and moisturizes); ruscus extract (strengthens blood vessels). Cleans the scalp right to the squeak, it's good for the next stages and for good penetration of products. Doesn't dry out hair. Of course, you should not expect results from one shampoo. The following steps are very important, I will talk about them later. Verdict: The shampoo does a good job of cleansing, which is very important in the process of fighting for your hair. Like a facial foam, for example, cleanses so that further lotions or serums penetrate the skin well",2

Ingredients: hyaluronic acid, tripeptide (synthesizes collagen), the secret ingredient is peppermint oil, it is he who should increase and cool the lips. The consistency is like a normal gloss - pale pink in color, not sticky, not greasy, comfortable to wear. Durability is normal. The finish is glossy. Does it increase the lips? No. There is a chill (as if they ate mints) and tingling for half an hour. Yes, it leaves a perfect feeling of freshness, but that's about it. Verdict: As a gloss, it's good, but I wouldn't call it a lip augmentation serum. Price: 780 R.",2

690,"We are watching how European beauty companies leave the Russian market one after another. I will try to tell more about our brands. For example, I tried eyeliners from Sergey Naumov, which are no worse than luxury ones. I have 4 shades: black, brown, green, blue. Matte finish, suitable for both evening and daily makeup. Durability is excellent, does not crack or smudge. The only thing is that such brushes are inconvenient for me, but I found a way out: I draw an arrow with a pencil, and then I tint it with eyeliner. The brush is very good for touching up the space between the eyelashes. By the way, the eyeliner contains a tripeptide that helps the growth and strengthening of eyelashes.Verdict: cool eyeliners for all occasions. Price: 2,350 R",2

It is better to apply mascara in 1 layer, otherwise the cilia will comb the eyebrows: it really lengthens. The consistency is a little thick, which is why it gives an impressive volume. The staying power is excellent, it doesn't run or flake off. Make-up remover is light, washed off with foam.

There were a lot of reviews on their products, but you need to remember two points: Art & Fact releases care with scientifically proven effectiveness and at a very low cost. In 5 thousand, you can put all the stages of care in general. And most importantly, the means are working: with acids, retinol, herbal / plant extracts and oils. I asked them a direct question, “Will the price of products rise?” The answer was: “We are not planning a sharp increase in prices - all products that are currently in stock and shipped to points of sale will be sold at our standard prices, however, an increase in prices is inevitable in the next few months.”",2

Ingredients: amino acids, peptides and hyaluronic acid of different molecular weights (gives long-lasting hydration), natural moisturizing factor (""cocktail"" of substances that help the skin absorb and retain moisture).

It should not be too dry (so that the lines are clear) or too thick (so that it does not run), that is, we need a medium texture pencil to create smooth lines.

In general, this brand is not so popular among Russians, but it was possible to order, for example, on Iherb, which we loved so much. Also, this brand is now represented in many pharmacy chains. They write that the bacterial infection found in Jergens creams and other products can cause serious problems in people with weak immunity. This only applies to products manufactured between October 1 and October 18, 2021. They have already been removed from the company's warehouses and continue to be removed from the shelves of other stores. But I can’t imagine how many people have already suffered because of one mistake and in what horror they read this news.

I have been using it for 2 weeks, the complexion has improved significantly, the skin is nourished and moisturized. Of course, wrinkles are in place, but serums or creams will no longer help them.

There is no feeling of a film on the face, does not make the skin oily. Tonal again after it lies well. The big minus for me is the pipette. You can tell she's not picking up.

Red pepper and nettle at the base - drives blood and accelerates hair renewal. Vitamin E, Panthenol and Apigenin - nourish and soothe the scalp.

The cream has many fans, so for constant use it is a savings. Again, it is also environmentally friendly. The cream itself has a dense texture, in principle, like all anti-aging ones.

Longevity is also good, the mascara does not run down and does not crumble. Make-up removal is simple: it can be washed off with any cleanser. Verdict: I advise fans of silicone brushes to take several packs at once. We order here.",2

For those who are not in the subject: these are patches with microneedles that are impregnated with active substances (1 cm2 of the patch contains 100 microneedles).

After using the needles, it does not remain, absolutely everything is absorbed. It moisturizes cool. Good for removing bruises and bags under the eyes.

In summer, in the very heart, the head from the scorching sun resembles a hayloft. Three products: shampoo, conditioner and spray.

The shampoo cleaned well (what else do you need?), coupled with the conditioner, after 5-6 applications I already noticed less porosity on the canvas. The spray has already “finished off” the effect. Hair looks definitely healthier and livelier than ""before"". Should I take it? Yes.

On her Instagram, she shared with subscribers that she had previously practiced washing her hair with onion decoction, and recently returned to this habit. Cardi even posted a photo with her hair down. By the way, her followers supported her.

As an addition to the usual care, it is quite suitable.",2
877,"As promised, I tried the sensational d'Alba White Truffle First Spray Serum. The very first and big plus for me is its versatility. Replaces: mist, toner, serum, essence. Can even be sprayed over makeup for added hydration throughout the day. In summer, it is ideal for those who do not like multi-stage: I cleanse the skin, spray and apply cream. The second plus is the composition. There are only natural oils, as well as Italian white truffle, avocado oil, chia seeds, vitamin E, niacinamide, etc. I liked the effect: it is absorbed immediately, does not leave stickiness.

Yes, it really cleans deeply, right up to the squeak. But at the same time, it dries the skin so much that even the cream does not help to moisturize afterwards. As a result, peeling appears. - narrowing of the pores. There is absolutely no effect. Verdict: if you need a budget tool for cleansing brushes and sponges, you can take it, but I do not recommend applying it to the face.",2

Adapts to skin color, hides pores, does not clog into wrinkles. The finish is radiant. The composition is quite for itself: collagen, peptides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, antioxidants and vitamins - everything you need for the skin. I also found a small drawback: a little oily skin after a couple of hours. But I think it's individual. Verdict: no good reason not to buy",2

Their job is to kill acne-causing bacteria, reduce redness, reduce sebum production, and at the same time moisturize. They do not contain alcohol and salicylic acid, so they should not dry the skin.

It additionally contains vitamins A and E. There is an effect: acne disappears in a week if used regularly every day. The finish is matte. - Spray for acne and pimples. I especially recommend it for the body (back, chest, shoulders). As part of the antimicrobial component (tetranyl U), D-panthenol. And I can tell you that he coped with the inflammation on my back.

But after drying, everything is ok: it does not stick the hair together and does not make it greasy. Curls do not “concrete”: natural styling is obtained. I really like that the serum adds shine to the hair. But get ready to smell a little weird: very sweet citruses. You'll have to be patient, it will fade eventually. Verdict: For daily styling, I definitely recommend.",2
887,"The natural trend seems to appeal only to women. Sharon Stone told Vogue Arabia in an interview that her boyfriend left her because she refused to inject Botox. Yes, and it happens. Sharon hasn't had Botox injections for over 20 years. The reason is serious: in 2001, she suffered a stroke and, as a result, a brain hemorrhage. The actress had to get more than 300 injections to get one side of her face back to normal. After that, Stone changed her views on aesthetic surgery, categorically refusing injections. I sincerely think that the actress looks great without Botox. I wish I could combine the rejection of injections with the rejection of Photoshop.",2
888,"Recently I told you about Nuxe oil, I also tried the foam from this brand - Very rose light cleansing foam. Designed for gentle cleansing. Whoever likes to wash himself to the creak, I will say in advance: this foam is not for you. The smell is not-re-al-ny: the aroma of a fragrant rose. Suitable for normal, combination and sensitive skin. The foam itself is dense, which means it is economical. The skin does not dry out, it refreshes: after washing, you feel cool. But cleansing is not enough for my oily T-zone. Verdict: for delicate cleansing, you can take it.",2

So, the consistency is light, creamy. The aroma is pleasant. The purpose of the serum is to moisturize the hair and make it more manageable. The composition is as follows: extracts of apple, kiwi and grapes; ceramides and active HI-CLERA (complex for moisturizing hair). But all this does not give the desired effect.

We urgently drag these photos to our masters",2
892,"Every girl knows that acids are an effective ""weapon"" against age-related changes. Here I experienced alpha-lipoic acid (also called ""thioctic""). The main properties of this acid: - slows down age-related damage in cells and reduces wrinkles - enhances the action of vitamins C and E - stimulates the blood circulation process - mattifies the skin, tightens pores - brightens age spots faces. In the mask, in addition to acid, there is shea butter (restores, moisturizes and nourishes). I close it with serum: it is absorbed immediately, but I let it work well and do not apply the cream for 5-10 minutes. I note that the serum does not leave stickiness. The result is this: the redness disappeared, the complexion became much lighter. Wrinkles of course in place, but small smoothed out. Pigmentation has become less noticeable. Definitely, there is an effect. The case when there is a desire to use further. I ordered everything from Wildberries. The prices are very affordable so I highly recommend it.",2
893,"Today we will analyze the favorite face cream for many girls - KIEHL'S Ultra Facial Cream. Why didn't I like him? The consistency is thick and rich. Distributed well. But I put a minus for the fact that it is absorbed for a long time, and after that it leaves a feeling of dryness and a film. Even the tonal foundation does not fit well, and the T-zone becomes oily after half an hour. The composition, however, is good: squalane comes first, as well as many natural oils and fruit acids. Verdict: despite the good composition, the cream did not suit me. Not enough moisture and the promised effect.",2

They are soaked in multivitamins and a cleanser. The napkin itself is very rough, literally exfoliates the entire skin, as a result it got redness. Doesn't remove makeup very well. After all, I went through the micellar water and there were remnants of the tonal base on the cotton pad! I have been tempted to try other products from this brand. Verdict: Wipes are only good for dusting. And I don't recommend it for the face.",2

This time around, Pat opted for the dark colors of Very Peri, both for the shadows and for the lips. My favorite is naked makeup with dark purple lipstick. By the way, you probably noticed that for the autumn-winter seasons, mostly dark tones were used, and for the spring-summer season, arrows in bright colors were chosen.",2
902,"The only thing missing in the beauty industry was Brad Pitt. Last week, he launched his Le Domaine anti-aging skin care line with the Perrin family of famous French winemakers. The key ingredient, you guessed it, is grapes. And Brad is already criticized online for the price tags: they are like in the luxury segment. Jars cost $80-385. Social media users on the brand's page write that creams with the same composition on the market are much cheaper. Totally agree with tiktoker Dulma Atlan's comment: ""It would be better if they just named Brad as an investor and campaigned with him without naming him as one of the co-founders."" Perrin grew grapes, research was conducted by a professor from the University of Bordeaux. And Brad, it turns out, is only the face of the brand. In an interview with Vogue, the actor says his routine is cleansing, serum and cream. But I forgot about the most important thing - spf. And such a mistake for the creator of a brand of skin care cosmetics is too rude. Let's see how long Pitt's brand will stay on the market.",2
903,"As soon as it gets a little cold, my hands become terribly dry and red. I have tried many creams, of course. And this time I took a balm from Librederm CERAFAVIT for atopic and very dry skin with ceramides and a prebiotic. At first glance, the consistency seems oily and dense, but when applied, it seems to melt, it is absorbed immediately. Leaves no greasy or filmy feeling behind. Fragrance like baby creams. In general, the cream is intended for the face and body, even children's skin. So I rub it on my babies. The effect is excellent: removed peeling, feeling of tightness and redness, the skin is soft. The children also approached: we did not have an allergic reaction. Verdict: I think this is a must-have in winter for the whole family.",2
904,"Classic French manicure, I think, few people do. The girls are experimenting. And one of the most popular options right now is golden. Yes, the time of manicure in dark shades is very considered, but golden is very warm and, in my opinion, very autumnal. If desired, you can add both brown and black to it.",2
905,"Over the summer, one might say, I lost the habit of doing makeup. I decided to update my makeup bag and took a primer from Laura Mercier Foundation primer. The texture is liquid gel. Apply as a moisturizer. Absorbs instantly, foundation can be applied straight away. Does not clog pores, evens out the face, the skin is velvety. The finish is declared as radiant, but there is no such brilliance, it only slightly illuminates the face. The make-up itself lasts longer, and the oily sheen does not appear even after a couple of hours. Separately, I plus for the fact that the base has a natural shade and evens out the overall skin tone. Therefore, you can do without tonic. Verdict: a solid base for every day.",2
906,"For those who celebrate Halloween, I suggest now to think about the image. I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of seeing rich makeup on everyone. Therefore, I propose a more relaxed version with makeup to focus on the costume. For example, you can make interesting arrows, like the daughter of Monica Bellucci, Virgo Kassel on the cover of Turkish Vogue. I'm sure it will be great if you add a bright or dark accent to the lips.",2
907,"Bella Hadid, I think, best of all adapts the trends from the zero. A striking example of this is the headband and elastic headband, such as Paris Hilton once loved to wear. Of course, all types of headbands suit her very well. I note that the bandage is relevant now, in the fall. Although somehow it warms the ears and prevents the wind from messing up the hair. But still, my favorite is a spring headband, it can be fit under any look, even an evening one.",2
908,"I share one more of my finds for the heating season - a lipid-restoring face and body balm from ART&FACT. The composition contains everything you need to make your skin happy: ceramides 1%, panthenol 1% and a moisturizing complex 5%. Medium consistency, absorbs instantly. I use mainly for the body. There is almost no fragrance. Leaves no film feeling. I am satisfied with the result. Firstly, the balm gives a divine feeling of freshness: the skin seems to start breathing again. Secondly, the skin becomes soft and supple. Peeling, feeling of tightness and redness, I do not observe. Verdict: another must-have for the winter on your shelf. Order before they're all sold out.",2
909,"Probably, many people recognized this legend of the fashion world in the photographs - 91-year-old model Carmen Dell'Orefice, who is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as a podium model with the longest career. So, Carmen is really still working and recently posed for the cover of New You magazine NAKED. She looks perfect for her age. Collected the secrets of her beauty. First, a healthy lifestyle and nutrition. Moisturizing the skin from the inside: she drinks a lot of water. Secondly, Carmen says that she has been using Spf for a very long time, she can even apply it at night: in case she suddenly forgets to do it in the morning. Carmen also uses an ointment instead of a cream, which is designed to care for the skin of horses and the udder of cows. The model admits that the aroma of this product is not very good, but it heals and nourishes the skin perfectly. I don’t know how honest these revelations are, but I really want to look like this after my 90th birthday.",2
910,"Do not underestimate the beauty gadgets from AliExpress. I always just read reviews. I share the list of my purchases (I found a cool selection in their magazine): - Magnetic gel face mask. It is reusable, can be used both chilled and for a warm compress + for extra care after the daily routine (helps the ingredients to quickly penetrate). By the way, the magnets here are for lifting. — Eye mask made of natural jade. Analogue of patches. Relieves fatigue and dark circles under the eyes. — LED eyebrow tweezers. Genious idea! You can capture even the smallest hairs. - Stencil-cat for eye makeup. Just a godsend for handymen like me. – Electric shower massage brush. A very handy thing for cleansing parts of the body that you can't reach! 5 nozzles for different areas. - Brush for massage and shampooing. Just pour the shampoo into the brush and massage. Improves circulation and exfoliates dead cells.",2
911,"I think every girl has a MAC lipstick in her makeup bag. And I am no exception. I love them for texture and durability. In general, I like lipstick in nude and brown tones, and sometimes you need, of course, bright ones. I share the shades that I have been using for many years: chili, mocha, kinda sexy, ruby ​​woo.",2
912,"I am very pleased that domestic brands began to develop at the speed of light. Personally, I have a lot of useful finds. I tried products from MIXIT SUPER FOOD. I'll tell you in detail. Shower gels: - Cream-gel with extract of coconut and honey. A huge plus is the divine aroma. The skin is perfectly hydrated and soft. After it, you can not smear with cream. — With extract of lemon and pineapple. Lemon - tones, and pineapple renews cells. The aroma is incredibly refreshing, the morning shower with it uplifts the mood. Shampoos: - Firming, with pink pepper and organ extract. Here, pink pepper is a growth stimulant, awakens dormant hair follicles and enhances the growth of new hair. Argan extract restores damaged hair. - Nutritious, with banana and avocado extract. The first gives the hair softness and silkiness, and the second restores. Both together deeply cleanse the scalp, the hair began to get less oily: already my head after 2 days. Firming balm-mask 3 in 1. It is also with pink pepper and argan extract. Enhances the effect of shampoo after deep cleansing of the scalp. We order everything here.",2
913,"The scariest Halloween nails are another reason to go for a correction. Black kitties, pumpkins and cobwebs are no longer an amazing and not very relevant option. Nail masters offer to try a glow-in-the-dark manicure. And also add black and red colors, as symbols of the most terrible holiday",2
914,"Finally, I tested Garnier's ""Super Shine"" face serum with vitamin C. Serums with vitamins are generally ""one love"". Judging by the composition, this serum is a strong remedy with a pronounced effect. So, for example, a whole ""artillery"" of the most powerful components - vitamin C, nicotinamide and salicylic acid - was thrown into the fight against age spots. I used the serum twice a day. Serum fluid, medium density. When applied to the skin, it spreads quickly and easily without leaving a sticky layer. The most important thing to note is that Garnier Vitamin C Serum affects the complexion. It becomes noticeably smoother and more uniform. The product does not cause any negative reactions for me. Good for dryness and flaking. It’s naive, of course, to expect a laser effect from a serum, but it lightened my pigmentation a little. I didn’t even expect that I would like this product so much. And do not forget that we do not go out into the active sun and do not use a cream with SPF, otherwise, instead of lightening the skin, even more pigmentation can be provoked. Best price now on Wildberries.#garnierrussia #vitaminC",2
915,"There are so many of ours in Turkey that local cosmetics are becoming very relevant. So I share my impressions of the blush that I took back in the summer from the Turkish brand Pastel. I have a shade - 44 Smile always. The texture is light creamy. The pigmentation is medium, the color is not saturated, so it is important not to overdo it with them. Zaire looks very natural. Another plus is durability: lasts almost all day! Life hack: I use this blush both as a lipstick (it looks cool), and sometimes as eye shadow (however, after a couple of hours they clog into folds). Verdict: Recommended for those who love creamy textures.",2
916,"Elon Musk has released a perfume for men with the smell of burnt hair Burnt Hair, which is sold on the website of his company - The Boring Company. The price is less than I expected - $ 100 per bottle. In two days, 20,000 copies were swept away! It seems that Elon lacked just a couple of million dollars to buy Twitter. On his page, he joked like this: ""Please buy my perfume so I can buy Twitter."" By the way, delivery to Russia is also available.",2
917,"I use thermal protectors all the time. This time I took a bottle from the American-British brand Tony & Guy. The manufacturers promise us protection even above 230 degrees. The scent is very pleasant but fades quickly. I apply it to slightly damp hair (this is important, because if applied to completely dry hair, the hair becomes matte + a little sticky) and proceed to styling. What's the effect? Hair does not weigh down, they are smooth and shiny. I determined good protection against high temperatures by the fact that split ends did not appear. Verdict: My recommendation and 5 out of 5 stars",2
918,"Doja Cat always finds something to surprise. We felt this in the past fashion weeks. The author of her beauty images is not a make-up artist, but an extremely talented artist, Laurel Charleston, whose work simply hypnotizes a person. I don't know about you, but I'm curious to see every detail. Laurel says he's tired of seeing naturally beautiful and thin models on the catwalks, he wants to show the world that makeup can be an extension of fashion. And looking at Doja Cat, it's hard not to agree",2
