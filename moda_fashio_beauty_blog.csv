This logo was a symbol of nuclear disarmament, and the British Campaign of Nuclear Disarmament (hence the abbreviation CND sign) adopted it the same year.",2
112,"The new Chlo√© collection proves once again that leather trousers are a worthy alternative to jeans. Gabriela Hirst is one of those designers whose collections should not just be looked at, but studied. Her label Gabriela Hearst and Chlo√©, where she has been creative director since last year, hides not only an important eco-initiative, but also concern for those who will wear these clothes (remember the pockets with silver particles that prevent radiation from smartphones?). For fall-winter 2022, Hirst created an entire capsule wardrobe made of leather for Chlo√©, and although it is not eco-leather, there is also a conscious approach here.",2
113,"Literally every model appeared at The Row Resort 2023 show. They complemented long bustier dresses, trouser suits, strict straight-cut midi skirts, coats and trench coats. For all of us, this is the first year when we might not even notice that spring has come, and this season loafers are needed more than ever. On our own, we add that you can wear them with jeans, and with suits, and with a skirt of any length, and with straight-cut trousers. And one more argument - loafers will be a smart investment in your wardrobe. In other words, you can be sure that in the coming years they will definitely not lose their relevance.",2
114,"Now, when such events are taking place in the world, it is difficult to concentrate on anything other than the news bulletin. The advice to get distracted in these realities would be inappropriate and hardly appropriate, but we also suggest thinking about your body and helping it cope with stress for which it was clearly not ready. And sports will be an effective medicine - whether it's just aerobics, running or intense training in the gym. Once you start, and you will immediately get involved in the process, and the new sports uniform will become an additional motivation.",2
115,"A white shirt gets along with tailcoats, alcoholic T-shirts, trouser suits and long skirts. They are a staple of Caroline Bessette-Kennedy's wardrobe and are still loved by Carolina Herrera. And it is also the basis of the office wardrobe and at the same time - paradoxically - and a symbol of freedom.",2
116,"Paris Fashion Week opened with a tribute show to Virgil Abloh, a man who, without exaggeration, changed the fashion world and people along with it. After the designer's death, it was immediately clear that the show of his latest Off-White collection (as well as the last collection of Louis Vuitton) would be emotional and memorable. To honor the memory of Virgil Abloh and pay tribute to him, supermodels and other stars took to the podium.",2
117,"Virgil is a designer to whom few people were indifferent. He was ardently loved by young people who were ready to spend the night in lines for sneakers from his new drop, and just as ardently scolded by respected fashion critics. An architect by training, a creative consultant and a DJ by vocation, he has created more mixtapes than groundbreaking designs in fashion. He was often accused of plagiarism and not taken too seriously - understanding the fact that he was part of a new generation of designers, but not accepting the vast majority of what he did.",2
118,"And Balenciaga seems to be planning to bring neon back into fashion. Yesterday, Demna unveiled the brand's new ad campaign, starring Kim Kardashian and Isabelle Huppert. The third protagonist of this shoot was a neon green Le Cagole bag (better known as a biker bag thanks to American Vogue editor Liana Satenstein). Kim appeared with her in the frame - in an all-black look - so this bag became the only contrasting accent.",2
119,"The previous creative director of Burberry, Christopher Bailey, by the way, made such an attempt in 2012. True, he invited Adele as a plus-size design consultant, which made the whole idea more like a PR stunt. The singer seemed to agree and even discussed something with Bailey, but judging by the fact that today she weighs almost 50 kilograms less, she failed to revolutionize the industry. I had to lose weight - now Schiaparelli couture dresses by Daniel Roseberry and trendy young designer Harris Reed are sitting on her like a glove.",2
120,"Alexandra Maniovich, who graduated from Parsons in Paris in 2020, says that the institute encourages students to create plus-size fashion, but does not contribute to this: ‚ÄúOn the one hand, teachers tell you: ‚ÄúThere are different sizes, races and shapes‚Äù , and on the other hand, they do not give you the opportunity to make clothes for them, except for your own money. There were two size M mannequins for the entire university - all the rest are French 36th, that is, S.",2
121,"Rihanna's photos from last week (of her in a pink puffer jacket and ripped jeans) made it hard not to notice not only the big news she brought to the world, but also the massive jewelry that highlighted her belly. And if a fashion diva like Rihanna chooses a catchy vintage Christian Lacroix, and even on such an important occasion, this is a clear sign that large jewelry is back in fashion. (Moreover, it is not the first time she appears in them.)",2
122,"Chanel In 1978, Carl launches his first signature Lagerfeld cologne for men. In the 1980s, Lagerfeld became artistic director of Chanel. He ingeniously handled the legacy of the brand. In a word, Lagerfeld gave him back his life, because after the death of Coco, Chanel fell on hard times.",2
123,"‚ÄúFashion is an attempt to visualize aspects of reality that are invisible to the eye,‚Äù he wrote in the accompanying booklet for the 2005 Metropolitan Museum of Art Chanel exhibition. From the very first Chanel shows, Lagerfeld demonstrated his insightful understanding of the importance of imagery and hype. His collections have gained iconic status, with models on the runway wearing branded hockey sticks, surfboards and shopping carts. ""Lagerfeld's strength is that he is equally good at creating context and fashion clothes""",2
124,"Do you want to quickly update your wardrobe for spring, without resorting to drastic rearrangements? Make him sparkle with new colors. To do this, just add a few trendy shades that are right now running the show at Fashion Week. Let them dilute your monochrome images and help bring warming closer. Do you believe in the power of color therapy? Let it begin to act on the weather. As Rihanna said, fake it till you make it. Meet the top five spring-summer 2022 colors to add to your wardrobe right now.",2
125,"Among the followers of the trend is the Mugler brand. Its creative director, Casey Cadwallader, continues the legacy of the great Thierry Mugler by creating sexy clothes using cutting-edge technology. ‚ÄúMugler‚Äôs concept is that clothes should not be restrictive, they should emphasize curves,‚Äù he said about his spring-summer 2022 collection.",2
126,"Florence Tethier, in her debut collection for Jean Paul Gaultier in 2021, referred directly to the brand's biggest hits: stretch tulle body stockings embellished with a recognizable Breton stripe and an optical illusion dress from the spring-summer 1996 collection. By the way, the vintage version was worn by Kim Kardashian in 2019. And Glenn Martens slightly updated the iconic mesh in his couture collection for Jean Paul Gaultier spring-summer 2022. We saw whimsical dresses with ruffles, rainbow print and other interesting details.",2
127,"There's still time before spring, and we can't wait to wear crop tops, miniskirts, and flowy dresses. As you update your outerwear, from light-coloured coats (while it's still cold) to trench coats, don't forget lighter pieces as well. In addition to shirts, T-shirts and T-shirts, you should also pay attention to bralettes. Influencers especially like to wear them with jackets - a standard combination, but on days when the weather changes every hour, they will help out as well as possible.",2
128,"in Milan, the Prada women's collection autumn-winter 2022 was shown - in the same place where Raf and Miuccia presented the last men's collection, in the Fondazione Prada building. The highlight of the new collection is the alcoholic tank top, an item that last hit the market just two years ago and that looks set to repeat itself in the near future.",2
129,"At the current Fashion Weeks, one global trend has been identified - designers are not trying to surprise anyone. The collections are based on simple, well-known wardrobe items ‚Äì for example, the new Bottega Veneta by Mathieu Blasy and Prada has a white T-shirt, Jil Sander has a classic jacket in basic shades, and Gucci, Sportmax and Tod‚Äôs have a gray coat. We usually say about the latter that this is a smart investment in the wardrobe, because the gray coat will definitely not become outdated and will not go out of fashion, and in the autumn-winter 2022 season it will be a trend at all.",2
130,"If you are planning to update your wardrobe, a gray coat will be a smart investment. For example, rich blues, blues and yellows, as well as all the basic colors, so an overcast sky or wet asphalt coat in practice will be no less versatile than black.",2
131,"When creating a dress for his muse, the designer can only guess if it will become iconic. In 2003, Jennifer Lopez appeared in a luxurious mint-colored Valentino toga dress, embroidered with crystals along the hem. Since then, it has been included in all the collections of her best outings of all time, and in large part thanks to the idea behind this outfit - namely Jacqueline Kennedy.",2

And will repeat it in 2001 for the Crown Princess of Greece Marie-Chantal and her appearance at the Met Gala. Not surprisingly, the theme of that year's Costume Institute ball was ""Jacqueline Kennedy: Years in the White House."" And although this dress belongs to the next period of Kennedy's life, it has become a cult in the history of her exits.",2
133,"So, the 55th Golden Globes ceremony. The Ray of Light Madonna, Michael J. Fox with another figurine, Kate Winslet shining after the Titanic - we definitely would like to visit this ceremony. Among the guests was Brooke Shields, who received a nomination for her lead role in the sitcom Unpredictable Susan. For her, it was a whole event, and, like any nominee, she approached the choice of outfit with special trepidation. The responsible mission was entrusted to Richard Tyler, now known to most as the judge of the Project Runway. Tyler has dressed top Hollywood actresses over the years and is one of Sarah Jessica Parker's favorite designers. For the Golden Globes in 1998, he created for Shields a scarlet bustier dress with a shawl.",2

135,"Doll, prom queen, Marilyn Monroe - throughout her career, Courtney Love tried on many roles, and each played in an original manner. An exemplary blond, smeared smoky and ‚Äúmoved out‚Äù red lipstick - an image that you can‚Äôt confuse with anyone. And also - dresses from the Hollywood diva's wardrobe and silk combinations, in which she went on the red carpet and on stage at the ready with a guitar. And in fashion, she is clearly an underestimated figure. You ask: how can you become an icon of style, if one day the designer himself saw a fake dress of his authorship on you? Actually, it's possible. The current times with starlets bred by Pygmalion image makers only prove this - such genuine and sincere ones can hardly be found now, and this is the most important thing in matters of style.",2
136,"This is also Haider Ackermann and yes, there is a concept here too. The main action of the film takes place at night, when the vampire heroes can finally go outside. ‚ÄúSo I decided that Tilda should be visible even at night, for this she should shine.‚Äù The image is not only an outfit, but also make-up, in which the designer also takes part. For example, in this case, red lips became his idea - they symbolize the blood that the main characters are forced to drink in order to continue to live.",2
137,"We are now, of course, not about the ultra-short dress of Santa's girlfriend, but about the top in the form of a butterfly, studded with rhinestones. He even appeared on the cover of the American ELLE - and on Salma Hayek herself, who then released several films and series a year. The cover was forgotten, but Mariah, who wore it in Madison Square Garden for a concert in honor of Diana Ross, was not. Top she complemented with jeans with a low rise popular at the time and graceful sandals.",2
138,"Barbra Streisand is a unique phenomenon of her time and a prime example of the fact that deviation from the mold leads to great success. She has always been a ‚Äúfunny girl‚Äù, a ‚ÄúMartian‚Äù, but most importantly, herself, and it was her acceptance of herself, in addition to her magical voice, charisma and acting talent, that became her main trump card up her sleeve. Today, Streisand is considered one of the most commercially successful women in show business - she is the only one who topped the Billboard 200 list for sixty years. Her musical career began in a gay bar in Manhattan in 1960, and in 1969 she received "" Oscar, and this time for his film debut - in the comedy Funny Girl by William Wyler. That evening was remembered not only by her and her fans, but in general by everyone who saw Streisand's outfit, at least in photographs.",2
139,"Naomi met Gianni Versace at the very beginning of her career. She was then 17 years old, but she had already posed for several editions of Vogue and received the title of one of the main models of her time. Subsequently, not a single show was complete without her participation. By the way, during the life of Versace, his shows were the only ones in which Naomi participated. Donatella Versace recalls: he even helped her dress for the show. He adored her, and she, thanks to his attitude towards her, considered herself part of the Versace family.",2
140,"As for the very definition of ""dangerous dress"", there is a nuance here. At first glance, a light, open and, well, very bold outfit, in fact, was a complex structure - a jumpsuit was sewn inside, warning against any embarrassment. Bella's main task was to carefully hide it, keeping the intrigue. Salser and Vautier had no doubts about the success, ""because Bella is self-confident and smart."" So the whole danger of the outfit came down to the failure of Operation Sensation - after all, if everyone knew about the existence of a secret leotard, it is unlikely that Bella would have hit the top requests in May of that year. Sometimes the legend is more important than the truth, and this principle has remained the main one for the industry over the past few years.",2
141,"Yesterday, Isabel Marant‚Äôs fall-winter 2022 collection was shown in Paris. To the live accompaniment of the American band Blonde Redhead (whose Isabelle Maran herself is a big fan of), models walked the runway in cargo pants, oversized jeans and fluffy sweaters.

143,"One of the main headliners of the show was Naomi Campbell, a close friend of the designer, who also took part in the show of his final collection for Louis Vuitton in January. Other legendary supermodels of the 1990s appeared on the catwalk - Amber Valletta and Helena Christensen. They know better than anyone how much fashion has changed with the advent of Virgil Abloh. A new galaxy of models on the catwalk was represented by sisters Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Adut Akech. And the link between the two generations was the mother and daughter of Cindy Crawford and Kaia Gerber.",2
144,"If you've been following fashion weeks, you've probably noticed the color purple. Like green in 2021, next year it will also be impossible to ignore it - at past shows, designers not only added a couple of accent details, but dressed models in all shades of this color from head to toe.",2
145,"What do you associate lavender with? Provence, candied violets from Ladur√©e, Jeanne Damas cardigan - for us, this color primarily symbolizes France. It is also the color of spring. As you know, the right shade can become an effective psychotherapy, so lavender, which reminds us of holidays and the warmest days, gradually migrated to the autumn wardrobe - when we especially miss the sun and other joys of life.",2
146,"Nicola Brognano's love for lavender does not end with a knitted dress. He also came up with a smart elongated cardigan with a fur trim, which he suggests wearing with a belt from zero and flared jeans - not only Paris Hilton in the early 2000s, but also Bella Hadid could easily dress like that.",2
147,"More and more international brands leave Russia every day. The work of stores (including online) has already been suspended in the country by H&M Group (H&M, COS, & Other Stories, etc.), Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, Pull & Bear, etc.), Kering and LVMH . How the situation will develop further is unclear. But one thing is clear: these changes will probably lead to an increase in interest in Russian brands.",2
148,"American college style has taken the fashion world by storm. For example, bombers are now worn not only by football team players, but also by street style stars, among them guests of the Fall-Winter 2022 Fashion Weeks. They mainly preferred vintage models with colorful appliqu√©s.",2
149,"Bombers were also presented by Matty Bovan at London Fall-Winter 2022 Fashion Week. The designer admits that he was inspired by punk style. In addition, Vetements and Versace had such jackets at the spring-summer 2022 shows, as well as Burberry and Givenchy at the 2022 cruise collections.",2
150,"Yesterday the first physical show of Cecilie Bahnsen took place in Paris. Danish designer and London-based Royal College of Art graduate Cecile Bunsen, whose airy ‚Äúprincess dresses‚Äù have become incredibly popular in 2020, showed on the catwalk everything that fashion influencers around the world love her brand for: doll-like, feminine, naive outfits, voluminous, but seemingly weightless silhouettes and a touching ""childishness"", which somehow coexists in her works with a complex design.",2
151,"We will never stop singing odes to French fashionistas - just look at the incredible Jane Birkin, Isabelle Adjani, Brigitte Bardot... Each had her own unique style, which glorified exquisite Parisian chic around the world. While casualness remains the secret ingredient to their success, it's always been based on practical pieces that are easy to mix and match. We have collected for you eight wardrobe items that we spied on in the accounts of Parisian fashionistas - let them help you put together a practical base that will not lose its relevance over time.",2
152,"Vest Yes, this is an eternal classic. She looks great with denim shorts on the beach, or with wool trousers and suede skirts in the city. Blue or black stripe - the choice is yours.",2
153,"Strict black loafers If classic loafers are experiencing a real boom in popularity this season, then they have never left the wardrobes of French women.",2
154,"If earlier it was believed that such a skirt was exclusively an attribute of a strict dress code, now, in the wake of the trend towards eclecticism, it can even be combined with things from an evening wardrobe. Beckham, for example, suggests wearing such a skirt with a bodysuit in sequins and over the knee boots. At Fendi, a sheer blouse complements a formal office skirt, and at Rochas, a gradient blue and gold brocade shirt. So, this model gets rid of the office label and may well become the basis of a basic wardrobe.",2
155,"At the current Fashion Weeks, one global trend has been identified - designers are not trying to surprise anyone.

156,"Yellow is the color of the sun, spring, fertility, sunflowers, wheat fields. We always look forward to March, because there is much more sun in our lives. For some reason, there are a lot of shades of the color of spring in the fall-winter 2022 collections of the current Fashion Weeks. This trend can be traced in the shows of Marni, MSGM, Botter and Nanushka, and Kwaidan Editions did not stand aside.",2
157,"We love the yellow trend. It is the color of spring, rebirth, life and prosperity. There is also a lot of yellow in the collection of Rushemi Botter for his brand Botter (previously he also served as creative director of Nina Ricci) - here it is bright, saturated, like the sun in children's drawings.",2
158,"Blue is the color of calmness, freedom and infinity. And also the color of a clear sky. Today, when we all hope that world peace is about to come, blue and all its shades seem to us more relevant than ever. When the Pantone Institute selected Deep Blue as the Color of 2020 for 2019, CEO Leatrice Eisman had this to say about Pantone: ‚ÄúIn these days, the need for faith and trust is especially acute. And Classic Blue, a durable and reliable blue hue, conveys that sense of confidence and constancy that we can always rely on.",2
159,"There are never too many white shirts, just as there is no single right style. With straight sleeves or with flounces, cropped or elongated, loose or tight - in a well-composed basic wardrobe, there should be different models.",2
160,"The protagonist of the new MSGM collection is a Yves Klein patent coat, deep blue, like a clear sky on a summer night. Francesco Risso is experimenting with the same shade - the Marni fall-winter 2022 show opened the look with a knitted blue suit. By the way, note that in both cases, blue complements yellow - MSGM has a pastel one, while Marni has a saturated one. Such a combo, regardless of shade, is always a win-win. Blue pairs perfectly with basic shades - beige (for example, a blue shirt with a cream jacket), black (you can borrow a trick from the Molly Goddard show and wear a delicate frilly dress with black brutal or sports shoes). It is worth experimenting with total blue - your favorite jeans will come in handy here.",2
161,"The collection had a lot of menswear. As we recall, back in 2020, Alessandro Michele announced that he did not want to depend on seasonality, deadlines and gender settings, and therefore Gucci reduces the number of shows to two per year. But the designer still included his Exquisite collection in the schedule of the Fall-Winter 2022 Fashion Weeks. This does not mean that the brand will return to the principles that were before Michele's announcement. So, in Milan, where women's clothing has been presented since February 22, Gucci showed a collection almost entirely consisting of men's looks. Of course, such labels are completely redundant when it comes to this brand. ‚ÄúI thought it would be interesting, especially now that we can have a more open dialogue in the fashion world. I like to do things differently,‚Äù Michele said after the show. ‚ÄúSeven years ago I came here with a menswear collection and the reaction was like I ‚Äòinvented‚Äô gender fluidity,‚Äù he recalls his first collection for Gucci.",2
162,"Collaboration with adidasThe collection was presented in collaboration with the adidas brand, which redefined sportswear in the 1970s and 1980s. This, of course, influenced the formation of Alessandro Michele's ideas about fashion. ‚ÄúAdidas has brought elegance to sportswear. I also tried to interpret this style in my own way. The result may seem simple, but the idea is really powerful,‚Äù he said. This was not an exaggeration. Despite the fact that we saw a mixture of styles on the catwalk, reflected in formal suits and evening dresses with elements of sportswear, this solution is not revolutionary in modern fashion. But at the same time, adidas' European roots made these looks different from the American sporty style that we usually see in fashion. The combination of oversized suits, luxurious jacquard coats and adidas logos had a classic 1980s gangster and retro aesthetic.",2
163,"Gucci and adidas logo accessories The Alessandro Michele show will be remembered for retro outfits, unexpected collaborations, club strobe lights, Bronski Beat's nostalgic soundtracks Smalltown Boy and Visage's Fade to Gray, as well as best-selling accessories. Large shoppers with bamboo handles, studded, studded or adidas stripes echoing the Gucci logo; unisex boots with lacing and large gold buttons on the sides; From baseball caps to swim caps and berets, adidas branded headwear is sure to be a must-have for fashionistas around the world.",2
164,"Victoria suggests wearing shoes and bright tights not only with evening, embroidered sequins, dresses, but also with voluminous anoraks, as well as with two coats at once (remember this trick from the Neil Barrett show? It looks like a trend is brewing). It is not necessary to wait for the coming autumn in order to try this trick - we have already collected for you bright tights and shoes that match each other in color. By the way, we advise you to experiment with the second term - loafers, for example, will become a worthy alternative to stilettos or heels.",2
165,"Moreover, Vaccarello also demonstrated the best way to wear such a dress right on the catwalk - with numerous massive bracelets and rings. So far, this look is our top favorite at Paris Fashion Week. In an almost identical image, by the way, just a couple of weeks ago, Kim Kardashian appeared in the video of the American Vogue Objects of Affection.",2
166,"The ""intermediate"" collection turned out to be very much in the spirit of Rushemi Botter and Lisi Herrebrug - exactly the same neon shades of green and blue are used, the silhouettes of outerwear are still voluminous, and elegant chiffon dresses, as before, merge here with outdoor elements. Unless there is not a hint of crazy hats that we will remember the era of Rushemi and Lisi.",2
167,"In fact, ballet shoes will never disappear from fashion without a trace. Despite the fact that their popularity subsided for a while, many fashionistas still had a pair of these shoes in their wardrobe. Especially often street style stars, actresses and models could be seen in iconic Chanel ballet flats. Back in 1957, Coco Chanel released slingbacks with an extended nose. Couturier has always been quite critical of her legs, so she made shoes that would visually lengthen them. Romy Schneider and Gina Lollobrigida and many other actresses became fans of this model. Today, the iconic two-tone shoes appear at Chanel every season in different iterations, including in the form of ballet flats. In one of them, Angelina Jolie appeared on the cover of British Vogue in March 2021.",2
168,"All the leather items you see in the Chlo√© fall-winter 2022 collection are made from the ""waste"" from Italian meat farms, working according to European environmental standards. ‚ÄúFor me, leather is a by-product of the meat industry,‚Äù Hurst says, hinting that zero-waste production on agricultural farms reduces the exploitation of animals in the fashion industry. If we talk about the collection itself, we would single out leather trousers in it first of all. We dedicate several articles to them every year, and for good reason. Firstly, this pair can form the basis of the wardrobe. Secondly, leather trousers do not wear out for a long time, even if we are talking about artificial material, which means that such a purchase will be an important step towards the formation of your own conscious approach.",2
169,"It is believed that if you look at shades of blue, breathing slows down, muscle tension weakens. But the main thing is the color of world peace. So, after the Second World War, the UN issued blue helmets, symbolizing liberation and goodness. Designers turned to the heavenly palette this season - in the collections of the autumn-winter 2022 season, we noticed a lot of shades of a peaceful sky.",2
170,"Designer Igor Chapurin presented a haute couture collection of 27 outfits at Moscow Fashion Week, and each one is unique. Created almost entirely by hand, of course, in a single copy. Despite the fact that it is haute couture, the models are devoid of excessive theatricality and can be easily imagined on any woman. At the first Moscow Fashion Week in the history of the capital, Igor Chapurin presents the Anthology haute couture collection. In it, the designer tries to rethink his heritage in the world of high fashion.",2
171,"Corsets, contrasting colors, bodycon silhouettes - Versace style sensuality Donatella focused on the construction: the silhouettes of the dresses are fitted exactly to the figure. And the key element was the corset bustier - not only as a top or top of a dress, but even as part of a down jacket.",2
172,"Sexy long gloves and very high boots The sensual aesthetic of the outfits is emphasized by long, tight accessories and shoes that seem to be an extension of the clothes themselves. The stars of the show are over-the-knee boots made of shiny vinyl material. With such it will definitely be convenient to wear trendy mini. In the new season, Versace continues to sing an ode to the high platform. Another form-fitting element of the show is long gloves that completely repeat the color of the top, which makes the whole look more harmonious.",2
173,"Celebrities on the runwayIn the 1990s, Gianni Versace created what is known as a model cult. For the designer, the fashion models embodied the essence of the brand, its concept of beauty. Just as Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Carla Bruni, Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen personified the Versace universe, Vittoria Ceretti, Bella and Gigi Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski and Lila Moss represent the brand today.",2
174,"Fendi Bag, Barneys Special CollectionIn 2008, the creative director of the legendary New York department store Barneys, Simon Doonan, decided to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the CND mark. To develop the Peace and Love special collection, Doonan enlisted key fashion industry players: Alber Elbaz (then at Lanvin), Nicolas Ghesqui√®re (then at Balenciaga), as well as Alexander Wang, Phillip Lim and even Karl Lagerfeld. ‚ÄúToday, a lot of people don‚Äôt know that this symbolism is associated with the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign,‚Äù Simon Doonan told The Guardian. ‚ÄúBut she still sends people a positive message of peace and love.‚Äù Finding pictures of a complete collection (and even in good quality) is an extremely difficult task today.

True, not to the feminist, but to the youth that took place in Paris in May 1968 against the background of the economic downturn and which eventually led to a change in the government of France. And although the pacifist sign is not directly related to the theme of those strikes, it is certainly associated with such events - that's why the designer placed it on a relaxed gray sweater. Which, by the way, has become one of the brightest items of that collection.",2

The figure turned out to be really impressive - as much as ten percent of the ten thousand things that 400 designers presented were somehow cut or cut in different places: on the shoulders, hips, chest and even the stomach. And sometimes everywhere at once.

Sets with portraits of influential women in history, new technologies in clothing combined with handicraft - what else you need to know about the collection, says British Vogue fashion critic Anders Christian Madsen.",2
211,"Shoes have become a kind of ‚Äúcode-breaking‚Äù of the fashion house. As part of her high-tech experiment, Chiuri turned to the Dior archives. She was inspired by the work of fashion designer Roger Vivier for the fashion house a decade ago, which can be described as the first ""designer codebreaking"" - as we now call collaborations between brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga. ‚ÄúWhen Vivier met Monsieur Dior in 1953, they decided for the first time in history to create pieces with their own logos. It was a way of recognizing Vivier as a master of his craft and a true couturier in the world of shoes, because all of his creations were presented in a single copy, ‚Äùexplained Chiuri. She reimagined the pointed toe and chunky soles that Vivier created at the time and structured them with D-Air Lab adjustable tech ankle straps. The result is a practical design that looks very modern.",2
212,"There was a place for manual work In addition to flirting with new technologies, Chiuri also relied on manual work. Floor-length skirts separated by delicate fringes, bustier dresses with embroidery, corsets and capes made of mesh - all this was painstakingly created by the craftsmen. Some of the looks towards the end of the collection were inspired by the Jardin d'Hiver tapestry that adorned Christian Dior's winter garden. Although it was a high-tech collection, the heart of Chiuri still belongs to the masters. ‚ÄúFor me, technology should help people live better lives. Not to escape reality. There should always be a human touch,‚Äù she said. This touch became the handwork of the masters.",2
213,"How did the works of the artists affect the design of things? Carrington used a very beautiful color palette in her works, which partly migrated to the collection. Some of Miller's photos seem to be in a haze, we used this technique in one of the dresses, sewing it from flowing velvet. Another dress is embroidered with the phrase Blanche et muette, habill√©e des pens√©es que tu me pr√™tes, which translates as ""White and silent, dressed in the thoughts you lent me."" There is an irony in it: this is a line from a poem by the Belgian poet Marcel Marien, men, and we wanted to convey the idea that women are not just muses, but artists.",2

So, for example, now Bratz dolls, which appeared back in 2001, have regained great popularity (later they made an animated series about them). References to them can be seen both in fashion designers (remember the cool chunky-soled shoes from Versace's autumn-winter 2021 collection) and in makeup artists.

It has long gone beyond the confines of the universities - today even pop stars like Steve Lacy do it. True, it will be possible to pull off such a trick only with penny loafers, which have such an overlay on the tongue, and not all loafers fashionable this season can boast of its presence. Purple Loewe, for example, do not have it, but is that a reason to deny yourself the pleasure of wearing them?",2

The creative directors of the brands Virginie Viart and Miuccia Prada agreed that gray knitted bandeau tops are the most fashionable purchase of the coming fall. In the Miu Miu collection, the knitted top is fastened with touching little buttons, while the Chanel version is adorned with a signature camellia brooch.

It has been adopted by many brands such as Adam Lippes, Rochas, Plan C, Rosie Assoulin and Partow. I especially advise you to pay attention to the pale pink Gabriela Hearst suit with a relaxed cut. Such softness has generally become one of the key trends of the season: this spring there are no masculine styles and excessive severity. Look for suits with fun prints at Sies Marjan, and feather-embroidered ones at Y/Project. If you still want a more business-like option, check out Rosie Assoulin's plaid suit with cropped trousers.""",2

In classic cut models, as in the Prada spring-summer 2021 collection, you can look no worse than in your favorite raincoat or coat. Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, for example, suggest turning sleeves up to the elbows and wearing them unbuttoned so you can play up the shade of a top or shirt by creating a color composition. If you like a raincoat without a hood, match it with a bucket hat - the main thing is that it be made of waterproof material, such as nylon or leather. A raincoat can be worn not only in the office - when going to a gala reception, throw it over an evening dress, as in the WOS lookbook, and you will find yourself the most fashionable guest.",2

Back in the late 19th century, when the founder of the company, Hamilton Carhart, had only two sewing machines and five employees, the work clothes he sewed in Michigan were famous for the highest quality. Legend has it that Carhart's denim was so thick that not even a bullet could pierce it.",2

The same gigantic shoulders and heads ingrown into them, the same dresses and leggings filled with floral ornaments. Puffy jackets from the last collection were reduced to vests, the commercial success of which is beyond doubt. To the ""Chinese"" bags of last season, the designer added a new variety - rectangular transparent bags, in which blankets and pillows are usually sold, according to Balenciaga, they are decorated with colors and patterns worthy of the cheapest Chinese linen. Meanwhile, the hysteria around Gvasalia continues. He is already credited with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãoversize, which is hardly less than the designer himself, and these very ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù bags, as if there was no scandalous collection of Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton with exactly the same bags only in a cage and as if there was no C√©line 2013 collection years, using these same prints.",2
